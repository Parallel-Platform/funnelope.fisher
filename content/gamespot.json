            "description": "<p style=\"\"> <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/dropsy/\">Dropsy</a>--a strange 2D point-and-click adventure about a clown detested by society--is refreshing and sincere. As an adventure game with no text or coherent speech, it subtly deviates from other games of its type. But in doing so, it faces its own share of issues, lacking clarity when needed, sometimes making it a chore to play. Fortunately, because Dropsy has a heartfelt narrative, imaginative non-linear environments to explore, and thought-provoking puzzles, you're drawn into its unusual world right from the start.</p><p style=\"\">Dropsy tells the story of a lovable clown of eerie countenance who becomes a social outcast in his small hometown, after being blamed for a mysterious fire that burned down his family's circus. Set on a quest for redemption, he has to clear his name by helping out strangers and giving them hugs (more on that unusual element later). Dropsy's story is a simple and elegant narrative that latches onto themes of selflessness and unconditional love in a meaningful way. It hits emotional notes, far more than what you'd expect from a game about a gleeful clown, telling an intimate and somber tale brimming with distinct personality.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-6426899\" data-src=\"/videos/dropsy-rocking-ministry-to-feed-the-hungry-gamepla/2300-6426899/\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe src=\"/videos/embed/6426899/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">What makes Dropsy distinct is how its story is delivered without text. Since Dropsy can't speak, dialogue is interpreted via speech balloons that visually depict a character's intentions or inclinations. For example: a character can tell you to go somewhere by displaying a pair of legs beside an arrow pointing to a specific location. While this approach seems counter-intuitive for a point-and-click adventure--a genre that traditionally thrives on its rich and explicit dialogue--Dropsy pulls it off with a great deal of success, creating a sense of impact in its storytelling that's both subtle and indirect.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Another part of what makes Dropsy compelling is its strange and vibrant world. Similar to games like <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/earthbound/\">Earthbound</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/the-neverhood/\">The Neverhood</a>, Dropsy has colorful locales packed with a cast of eccentric characters, each with their own humorous mannerisms. From a beefy overactive cop to an oversized baby-like king of the junkyard, Dropsy has plenty of memorable personalities to interact with. But despite these whimsical qualities, there's also an underlying despondency to the game's world. After all, the people in Dropsy have problems and unfulfilled desires. Whether it be a woman yearning to feel loved or two long lost brothers who wish only to be reunited, it's up to you to help them out. This is where the game's puzzle solving comes into play.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2913024-dropsy+-+screen+10.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2913024\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2913024-dropsy+-+screen+10.png\"><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1197/11970954/2913024-dropsy+-+screen+10.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dropsy is a bit of a misunderstood individual.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">As you'd expect from a point-and-click adventure, Dropsy's gameplay is fueled by puzzles. They're challenging, but solvable through keen observation and patience. Some solutions can be as simple as combining an item in your inventory with the right object in the right environment, whereas others can be more intricate in design. One puzzle, for instance, has you using Dropsy and his various small controllable animal companions--who each have their own unique abilities--to meticulously navigate through a series of vents to disable a turret. While none of the puzzles in Dropsy are particularly groundbreaking or different compared to other games of its type, they often offer a level of complexity substantial enough to be interesting and engaging.</p><p style=\"\">Dropsy also benefits from its non-linear design. Taking place on a small island town, you're able to explore the game's world and tackle its main story at your own pace. There are plenty of side-quests to complete, which come in the form of simple two-step puzzles presented by the world's various inhabitants. A day and night system also subtly alters the routines of town residents, paving the way for exploration and discovery of new details scattered across the world. These features loosen up Dropsy's progression, preventing you from feeling locked into specific puzzle solving sequences, allowing for a greater sense of freedom.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2913020-dropsy+-+screen+7.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2913020\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2913020-dropsy+-+screen+7.png\"><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1197/11970954/2913020-dropsy+-+screen+7.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dropsy has little animal friends who can help him along in his adventures.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">For all that Dropsy does well in its puzzles and progression, it isn't without problems. At times, puzzles and objectives can be too ambiguous, much to the detriment of its flow. Common frustrations I had were linked to visual objectives being unclear and some items being difficult to identify. While some entertainment can be had from making sense of Dropsy's ambiguity, these issues persisted, and there were times when I was sent wandering across the map with little or no idea what to do.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">When you do overcome these issues and eventually solve the game's various puzzles, you're treated to the reward of Dropsy's only form of expression: hugging. You can hug most things in the game's world and it even has its own stand-alone command. While this sounds like a cheesy feature or gimmick, it's an uplifting element to Dropsy's gameplay that's reflected onto the game's world. For instance, after helping a disenfranchised religious woman discover a calling to help the homeless and hugging her, she could be seen later with a smile on her face, taking care of people at her church. And with every person you helped or hug, a crayon drawn portrait of them will even appear in Dropsy's house.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">It's moments and details like these in Dropsy that add an emotionally rewarding sense of fulfillment to your actions. These gestures of kindness mean something to everyone you help, and it's Dropsy's selflessness in the face of his own misfortunes that make the game feel incredibly moving. It's a sentimental notion, but its lasting effect makes the game a heartwarming experience that stretches beyond the rudimentary quirkiness it initially presents.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2913016-dropsy+-+screen+3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2913016\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2913016-dropsy+-+screen+3.png\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1197/11970954/2913016-dropsy+-+screen+3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1197/11970954/2913016-dropsy+-+screen+3.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The dialogue in Dropsy is relayed entirely through visuals.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Upon first glance, Dropsy appears as a simple and offbeat textless point-and-click adventure that seems to pride itself on its eccentric world and premise. But once you give that first hug and imbue its grieving world with a small act of generosity, there's no denying the monumental effect of its charm. Even with issues rooted in its own ambiguity, Dropsy manages to be a captivating game with its genuine narrative, non-linear world, and stimulating puzzles. It's a game well worth playing, if only to feel the warmth of its loving embrace.</p><p style=\"\"> </p>",

            "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">LEGO Dimensions starts in an unusual way: it asks you not to play the game. After some short, perfunctory in-game tasks, Dimensions takes a swerve, telling you to put your controller down and build (using actual LEGO pieces) a physical portal that sits atop the real-world base you'll use to interact with the game. The portal itself is attractive and intricate, and depending on your fine motor skills (and whether you have children helping/hindering you), could take at least an hour to build.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-6425655\" data-src=\"/videos/lego-dimensions-e3-2015-stage-demo/2300-6425655/\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe src=\"/videos/embed/6425655/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">You don't actually have to physically build anything to progress within the game, but that off-game opening speaks to a confidence developer TT Games seemingly has in LEGO Dimensions, both as an actual toy and a virtual one. It's a confidence that's well founded. The appeal of building LEGO is near universal, and only the biggest curmudgeons would deny the appeal of Dimension's charming fusion of several huge entertainment franchises within its sprawling gameplay. LEGO Dimensions works unquestionably, unequivocally, as both a toy and a game, and it feels like the high point of the many LEGO titles that have come before it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">What's remarkable is that despite Dimensions being the long-running LEGO series' first foray into the toys-to-life genre, the newly physical nature of this game isn't its most noteworthy aspect. Previous LEGO games have showcased the series' irreverent, playful takes on huge pop culture franchises, but Dimensions significantly ups the ante by shoving multiple properties into one gigantic mash-up. The in-game premise is that the evil Lord Vortech is attempting to destroy all of the various LEGO dimensions and combine them into one; in reality, it's a handy excuse to see worlds and characters from some major franchises collide, including <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, the DC universe, <em>Doctor Who</em>, <em>The Simpsons</em>, the <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/portal/\">Portal</a> games, <em>The LEGO Movie</em>, and more kid-friendly series like <em>Scooby Doo</em>, <em>Ninjago</em>, and <em>Legends of Chima</em>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The result is, in many cases, outstanding. There's an undeniable joy to be had in seeing Batman use the Bat Signal to defeat Sauron, or the Joker destroy the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, or the off-handed way the Doctor addresses Portal's GLaDOS as the \"faulty A.I.\". My favourite--and forgive me for venturing into possible spoilers here (skip to the next paragraph if you're wary)--is a short sequence during the boss fight with GLaDOS. In the midst of this fight, a dimensional rift appears, pulling in HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey in the room. HAL is supposed to be a distraction, an opportunity for you to defeat GLaDOS during her preoccupation with the strange AI that just popped into her testing chamber. Instead, I put my controller down and just listened, transfixed by the pair's hilarious banter.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/536/5360430/2889171-ld-screen-163.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2889171\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/536/5360430/2889171-ld-screen-163.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/536/5360430/2889171-ld-screen-163.jpg\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Many of the dimensions the game takes you to is filled with moments like these, and I looked forward to every rift, every intrusion, wondering what was going to happen next. The LEGO games' light touch and cheeky nose-tweaking of the franchises it portrays has always been one of the series' highlights, and it's in fine form here. <em>Doctor Who</em>'s world, for example, is impressive. Nods to fans abound, from Bad Wolf graffiti on walls, to mysterious, glowing cracks in surfaces, to the excellent way the menace of the Weeping Angels was translated into a child-friendly video game. The stages based on classic Midway games, too, show ingenuity, changing the game to a top-down Gauntlet-like experience in one instance, to a 2D-shooter in another.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Other worlds were less impressive. The Wild West of <em>Back to the Future</em> is nondescript, feeling little like the source material outside of a few folks named after characters in the third BTTF movie. The New York of the <em>Ghostbusters</em> world, too, felt lacking. But even in the midst of my disappointment, I heard some of the cheesy '80s pop songs from the <em>Ghostbusters</em> soundtrack play, and I smiled. In LEGO Dimensions, the little touches are oft times as affecting as the major strokes.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/536/5360430/2889165-ld-screen-155.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2889165\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.60810810810811\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/536/5360430/2889165-ld-screen-155.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/536/5360430/2889165-ld-screen-155.jpg\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Despite the age of some of these franchises, make no mistake: while much of the humor, references, and gags may be aimed at grown-up gamers, LEGO Dimensions is still unabashedly a family-friendly game, one that's best played with an adult assisting a child. The game's basic foundations remains true to previous LEGO titles--simple combat and controls, and no real penalty for dying. Each of the characters you control features one or two abilities specific to them--these become the basis for solving the game's most simple puzzles. Only Batman, for example, can use a Batarang to activate a switch, while Gandalf's magic is required to move certain blocks. This simplicity sometimes led to frustrations in Dimensions--driving controls, for example, felt too rudimentary, making it fiddly to manoeuvre vehicles into tight spots.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">But the gameplay strength of the LEGO series has always been with its environmental puzzles, and Dimensions features some of the most creative yet seen in the series. They start simply, with the game giving you the ability to teleport characters around, or change their size, or lend them specific elemental powers. By the end, when you're asked to combine powers in increasingly intricate ways to progress past puzzles, finding the right solutions was often times rewarding.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/536/5360430/2889151-ld-screen-96.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2889151\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/536/5360430/2889151-ld-screen-96.jpg\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_small/536/5360430/2889151-ld-screen-96.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_small/536/5360430/2889151-ld-screen-96.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">LEGO Dimensions comes with physical LEGO pieces that you have to build into sets (like the aforementioned portal base), characters, vehicles, or accessories. You place the characters, vehicles, or accessories (which you attach to small discs, which is where all of the information on that particular piece is stored) on the base, and voila: they'll pop up on your television ready to be controlled. The game's starter pack comes with Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle (from <em>The LEGO Movie</em>), as well as the Batmobile.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">You can complete the main narrative with the starter pack alone, but as is the case with other toys-to-life games, some content is locked to specific characters or sets that require separate purchase. In this case, characters and objects from the other worlds within Dimensions are sold separately which, if you're a veteran of the LEGO games, can seem somewhat annoying. Needing specific characters to access areas or activities is nothing new in a LEGO game--you simply had to amass enough in-game studs to purchase. In Dimensions, you'll have to use real money. Thankfully, there's a significant amount of content available within just the basic pack; finishing the main quest line should take more than 12 hours, depending on how obsessive you are about collecting studs within levels.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Outside of the narrative, Dimensions also features large, open world sections dedicated to each franchise, and all you need is a character from that franchise to unlock it (that means with the starter pack, you have <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, DC Universe, and <em>LEGO Movie</em> open worlds already unlocked). These open world sections are separate from the main narrative and include various activities like checkpoint races, simple quests, and plenty of collectibles. While they don't feature the same level of intricacy the main game provides, they do add several more hours each to the overall experience, so the pain of buying a Homer Simpson pack just so you can use him within the main game can be somewhat mitigated knowing it also unlocks a virtual Springfield for you to play in.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2917411-ld_gameplayscreenshot_38.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2917411\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2917411-ld_gameplayscreenshot_38.jpg\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_small/1197/11970954/2917411-ld_gameplayscreenshot_38.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_small/1197/11970954/2917411-ld_gameplayscreenshot_38.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">So far, so basic for a game in the toys-to-life genre. But LEGO Dimensions takes things a step further. It requires you to almost constantly interact with the real LEGO figures on your base to solve in-game puzzles or avoid in-game obstacles, with the base having three different sections that light up depending on what's happening on screen. Wicked Witch of the West got Batman trapped in magical chains? Simply move the Batman figure off the red-colored area of the base to free him. Need to teleport a character to a specific spot within the level? Then move the real toy onto the appropriate color-matched spot on the base. Some of Dimensions' most complex puzzles and challenging bosses require a huge amount of moving toys around, making the game an extremely tactile experience. In LEGO Dimensions, sometimes you're manipulating real LEGO as much as you are holding a controller.</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Make no mistake: while much of the humor, references, and gags may be aimed at grown-up gamers, LEGO Dimensions is still unabashedly a family-friendly game, one that's best played with an adult assisting a child.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">It's this real world activity that makes Dimensions a unique experience. As toys, these are in every way the same as any other LEGO set you would buy--great build quality, simple in design but often times intricate in construction, and fully adaptable with other LEGO bricks you already have. There's nothing stopping you from putting Gandalf's hat on Batman, or ignoring instructions and building the portal to your own design, or even foregoing building altogether (after all, all you need to actually play the game are the ID discs for each character). But for me, Dimensions' endearing nature and interactivity with the real world made me want to build, and it's a feeling that's bound to intensify if you play with a young one.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">In the first few hours of LEGO Dimensions play time with my six-year-old son, almost half the time was spent on playing with blocks. We built the portal together. We built the Batmobile, and then opened up a Scooby Doo pack and built the power-up Scooby Snack and Mystery Machine located within. We then hit the Wizard of Oz world, with Batman's head comically poking out the top of the Mystery Machine. In any game within the toys-to-life genre, there's sometimes an unspoken question: is this also a great toy or just a great game? In LEGO Dimensions' case, the answer is easy: it's both.</p>",

Still the most famous game in Nippon Ichi Software's growing catalog, the title introduced players to the Netherworld and Celestia, two mystical realms populated by fallible angels and loveable demons. But that was twelve years and two console generations ago. It's easy to look at screenshots of the newest title in the series--still sporting grid-based combat and the same general art style on the PlayStation 4 as ever--and wonder if the franchise has anything worthwhile left to say.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">With Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance, the development team proves it hasn't run out of new ideas. Numerous elements from past installments return, from general narrative themes to time-worn mechanics, and the ability to design your own maps to challenge friends and strangers online, mostly without ever feeling like a copy-paste job. The usual elements are all still here, but they're augmented by numerous new systems that should surprise even franchise veterans. In fact, the game's primary weakness is that there's now more to see and do than feels practical.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941171-0004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2941171\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941171-0004.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2941171-0004.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A bribe works as well in the Netherworld as it does anywhere else.</figcaption></figure><figure data-embed-type=\"gallery\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941196-0001.jpg,http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941197-0002.jpg,http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941198-0003.jpg,http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941199-0005.jpg,http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941200-0007.jpg,http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941201-0008.jpg,http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941202-0010.jpg,http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941203-0011.jpg,http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941204-0014.jpg,http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941205-0016.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2941196,1300-2941197,1300-2941198,1300-2941199,1300-2941200,1300-2941201,1300-2941202,1300-2941203,1300-2941204,1300-2941205\" data-resize-urls=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941196-0001.jpg,http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941197-0002.jpg,http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941198-0003.jpg,http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941199-0005.jpg,http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941200-0007.jpg,http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941201-0008.jpg,http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941202-0010.jpg,http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941203-0011.jpg,http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941204-0014.jpg,http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941205-0016.jpg\" data-resized=\"\" data-resize-url=\"\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941196-0001.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941196-0001.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941197-0002.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941197-0002.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941198-0003.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941198-0003.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941199-0005.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941199-0005.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941200-0007.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941200-0007.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941201-0008.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941201-0008.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941202-0010.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941202-0010.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941203-0011.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941203-0011.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941204-0014.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941204-0014.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941205-0016.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1406/14063904/2941205-0016.jpg\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">In general, the game progresses the same way Disgaea games always have: players meet a group of semi-heroic demons and guide them through battles, with heaps of anime-influenced dialogue filling in the plot between each strategic skirmish. A series of five or so battles serves as an episode, and then there's a preview of coming events before the process repeats. What made the routine feel so special in the past was the customization between each fight, when you were tweaking your characters and purchasing equipment and diving into optional battles in the rewarding \"Item World.\"</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\" data-align=\"center\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">With Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance, the development team proves it hasn't run out of new ideas.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Disgaea 5 tweaks all of that to make it feel the slightest bit more epic. The adjustments start with the ambitious story arc, which revolves around a strong demon named Killia who reluctantly falls in with Seraphina, a beautiful vixen--and also overlord--who fixates on her new friend because he somehow is able to resist her coquettish charms. Their ranks soon swell with the introduction of additional overlords, many dragging along some emotional baggage that is explored fully in due time. Together, the unlikely group of companions forms an alliance and seeks to defeat Lord Void Dark, a villain who apparently won't rest until he has obliterated every netherworld in existence.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Most episodes introduce new netherworlds instead of new regions within a given world, which seems like a small thing, but still manages to raise the stakes compared to past games within the series. Rather than returning to a castle after each battle, the heroes jet about the universe in a huge craft that serves as the level hub. Between stages, you'll wander that vessel, purchasing equipment or talking to NPCs or your friends. Often, the latter will appear with a red \"!\" over their heads, indicating you should expect a brief comedic skit. There's no voice work here, and no animation, but the artwork and clean translation do an effective job of conveying everything and reinforcing character traits in a way that pre-battle chatter cannot. The result is a crew of characters that's more likely to stick with you than any the series has introduced since the PlayStation 2 era.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941175-0006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2941175\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941175-0006.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1406/14063904/2941175-0006.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There are some elements in the game that you’ll swear you’ve seen before.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">A lot of the game's other enhancements are more specific. Many of them concern the Item World, which isn't accessible until you've cleared several episodes. All of a sudden, you have a compelling reason--and the means--to venture into that endless dungeon. You'll battle monsters on randomly generated floors until you conquer an \"item general,\" and whether you continue afterward is up to you. Returning fans will recall that the Item World is the single best way to level up characters and overcome roadblocks in the game's proper story campaign. That's truer now than ever before.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Every few floors, especially as you venture deeper into a given item's world, or after talking to a certain character and revising your path, you'll encounter random events. A goddess might fly by and drop an egg, which produces one of several characters. A Level Fish boosts your items when you clear floors, but only if one of your team members gets to it before enemies do, and protects it for a couple of turns before you ascend to the next floor. Or you might encounter a Stout Bottle that runs around on the map. You can obtain \"Evilty\" scrolls if you beat him, which in more peaceful times allow you to teach skills or passive abilities to one of your party members. There are other characters, as well, including an overpowered foe that can kill you in one hit if you don't find a way to escape within the first turn or two.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The Item World also plays host to invasions, where you can destroy a hostile to eliminate an area effect it casts on the field. You also gain parts that you can attach to your own vessel, and you can summon it to battle to aid you as you journey further into an item. Naturally, there are also plenty of random rooms, and these offer the chance to obtain precious loot, face a challenging battle, or even just take a breather. It's possible to spend dozens of hours within the various Item World stages and still not see everything.</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\" data-align=\"center\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Returning fans will recall that the Item World is the single best way to level up characters and overcome roadblocks in the game's proper story campaign. That's truer now than ever before.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">There's another new feature called Squads. As you progress through the campaign, you'll eventually meet certain requirements and divide your characters into specialized groups. Doing so doesn't mean you have to rely on a particular squad in battle, but each team member gains different perks. For example, members in one unit will gain experience points without battling, as long as their leader is out in the field and doing damage. Another can learn the ability to capture weakened enemies, which another squad can then interrogate back at base. From there, it's possible to recruit a former enemy to serve as your ally.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941172-0009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2941172\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2941172-0009.jpg\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2941172-0009.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2941172-0009.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Treasure your time in the Item World.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Even after you clear the main campaign, you can keep playing and continue unlocking new squads and characters and maps and episodes. Well ahead of that, there also are side quests to keep you busy. Talk to a particular character and he will reward you when you defeat enough of a certain enemy, or gather certain rare items, for example. Then there's the \"Character World,\" which sounds like the Item World but actually plays more like Mario Party, complete with items you can use to get the drop on enemies while you try to avoid landing on spaces that will impose a penalty.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The game and its numerous systems are a complete time sink that allows you to spend dozens of hours building your perfect character, and then tempt you to do it again a few more dozen times. Disgaea 5 is the biggest and most satisfying installment in the series to date, and It could easily be the last one you ever need to buy.</p>",

            "description": "<p style=\"\">Persona 4: Dancing All Night is the latest spin-off of the venerable RPG classic from 2008, <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4/\">Persona 4</a>, and as the title suggests, this isn’t an RPG, but a rhythm game. It’s not a terrible concept at all: the <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/persona/\">Persona</a> titles are routinely praised for their excellent soundtracks, and other beloved RPG series have found great success in exploring the music-game genre--namely, <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/theatrhythm-final-fantasy/\">Theatrhythm: Final Fantasy</a>. Unfortunately, the marriage between “Persona” and “rhythm game” found here is a rocky one at best.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">When you jump into the game, you find a very unusual layout. The image of the characters dancing their hearts out hog a good chunk of screen real estate in the center, while circles representing the up, left, down, triangle, circle, and X buttons line the left and right edges of the screen. As star-shaped beats spin out from the screen’s center to the rhythm of the music, you tap those keys as they line up with their corresponding button signal.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-6425650\" data-src=\"/videos/persona-4-dancing-all-night-gameplay-at-e3-2015/2300-6425650/\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe src=\"/videos/embed/6425650/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">While the basics will be instantly familiar to anyone who has played rhythm games before, the layout makes gameplay feel messy. Unlike a game such as <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/rock-band/\">Rock Band</a>, where all of your notes are grouped on a single, easy-to-read area of the screen, the notes in Dancing All Night flow out in two directions.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">You have to simultaneously keep track of the left-side and right-side of the screen, all while a big distracting image in the middle vies for your attention. The images in the center can get so busy that they distract from being able to see the beats you need to hit as they flow outwards. It’s a confusing and frustrating layout that leads to a lot of missed notes. The track planning also feels somewhat off: actions like holds and simultaneous multi-button presses seem to be tossed in randomly, rather than to emphasize key points of the song.</p><blockquote data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Once you’ve unlocked every costume and bought every item, Dancing All Night isn’t fun enough to justify challenging yourself and replaying songs for higher scores.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">At least those visuals in the middle of the screen are eye-catching. The Persona 4 cast has never looked better than they do now, and they all come with a variety of costumes and accessories you can deck them out with. (My personal favorite is Teddy in the Igor outfit). But once you’ve unlocked every costume and bought every item, Dancing All Night isn’t fun enough to justify challenging yourself and replaying songs for higher scores.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2940877-marie_alt+%284%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2940877\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2940877-marie_alt+%284%29.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1406/14063904/2940877-marie_alt+%284%29.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dress-up dance parties are the best dance parties.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">All of the various Persona spin-offs are known for having lengthy, dialogue-heavy story modes as one of the key selling points of the game. Dancing All Night is no exception, delivering players a story set some unspecified time after the events of Persona 4. The idol singer Rise has invited everyone to join her onstage at the Love Meets Bonds Festival event, where she’ll be performing alongside another up-and-coming singing group of young girls called Kanamin Kitchen.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">There are some strange things happening as the event looms, however: rumors of a cursed video on the event’s website are circulating, people are bringing up an idol who committed suicide years earlier, and the lead singer of Kanamin Kitchen, Kanami Mashita, is having unexplained headaches and blackouts. When her group members vanish under mysterious circumstances, it’s up to the Investigation Team to battle through the Midnight Stage – a realm filled with Shadows that can only be spoken to through the emotions of dancing.</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\" data-align=\"center\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Dancing All Night plays this ridiculous premise completely straight - to its detriment. What results is a story that feels less like Persona and more like an after-school special.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">That all sounds pretty silly, right? It’s hard to take a premise of “overpower evil with the magic of dance!” seriously. Unlike <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/persona-q-shadow-of-the-labyrinth/\">Persona Q</a>, which embraced and ran with its frequent goofiness, Dancing All Night plays this ridiculous premise completely straight - to its detriment. What results is a story that feels less like Persona and more like an after-school special.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The narrative tries to hit many of the same themes the original Persona 4 did so well – forging bonds with others and being comfortable with yourself – but it does so in the most preachy, hamfisted way possible. New characters, like Kanami’s bandmates, are introduced and put in peril, but given so little screen time that it’s hard to emphasize with them and their plight. An entire sub-story featuring Dojima and Nanako is present, but ultimately feels like a vehicle to introduce fan-favorite Nanako as a dancer. Given the standard of writing and characterization this series has frequently delivered in the past, Dancing All Night’s story is an utter disappointment.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2940880-2015-06-22-162820.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2940880\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2940880-2015-06-22-162820.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2940880-2015-06-22-162820.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Unlike Persona 4 and its other spin-offs, Dancing All Night's plot is a disappointment.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">I realized that I wasn’t enjoying Dancing All Night as much as I’d hoped when I first finished playing through a song in Story Mode as Yukiko. Her Persona, the elegant Japanese flower blossom figure Konohana Sakuya, suddenly materialized a saxophone and started wailing on it. “Are you serious?” I said to my Vita in disbelief as Sakuya bopped around. In a game universe where people get sucked into TV worlds and thinking, feeling robots are a thing that exists, my suspension of disbelief was finally shattered. It never recovered.</p><blockquote data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The only thing that really feels fun is playing dress-up with characters and their various outfits.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">In addition to the story mode, there’s also Free Dance mode to explore, which lets you play individual tracks to your liking on one of three difficulty levels. As you complete songs, you unlock new tracks and earn cash to spend in the in-game shop for helpful items and character costumes. There are a lot of great tracks from Persona 4 and various other spin-offs in the mix, along with several remixes of varying (usually not very good) quality. Despite the presence of some classic Persona 4 tunes, the track list feels rather anemic: there are 26 non-DLC songs, six of which are alternate remixes. The small number of tracks – and the general lack of variety – means you’ll see all Dancing All Night has to offer in terms of music pretty quickly before you have to pay for DLC.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Dancing All Night might have sounded like a fun idea on paper, but it simply doesn’t hold a candle to better portable rhythm games. The story is disappointing, the gameplay is mediocre, and the only thing that really feels fun is playing dress-up with characters and their various outfits. Unfortunately, Dancing All Night is hardly a consolation for those itching for a Persona fix. This is one all-nighter it’s probably OK to sleep through.</p><p style=\"\"> </p>",

            "description": "<p style=\"\">I was two touchdowns up and they hadn’t stepped into my half, yet I was going to lose. In previous matches, against Dark Elves, Dwarfs and High Elves, I’d relied on focusing superior numbers of human players around my Ogre, to get support for blocks on the enemy hard targets. Once they were down (knocked out or stunned) I could quickly create a channel through to the endzone for my ball-carrier. My mistake was thinking we could go toe-to-toe with Orcs. Their array of<b> </b>Blitzers and stronger Black Orcs meant that I had to spread my hard hitters more thinly, and couldn’t take them down as quickly as they could my players. Halfway through the match I looked down and saw my injury box full of K.O.ed players and nobody left on the bench. Losing seemed inevitable...</p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/blood-bowl-2/\">Blood Bowl 2</a> is a note-perfect recreation of a Games Workshop tabletop American Football game set in the Warhammer Fantasy Battle universe. That means it’s turn-based, packed with dice-based randomness and heavy with rules that are quite mystifying to new players. Oh, and it’s chock-full of Orcs, Vampires, Skeletons, Ogres, Trolls, Elves and Dwarfs, violence, and cheating.</p><p style=\"\">In a typical match, players (either human or AI) take turns moving and blocking with their team, whilst trying to get the pigskin ball from their half to the opponent’s backline for a touchdown. Just like American football, passing is a huge gamble and many teams just play a running game, or even a hitting game where you just try to injure your opposing team.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-6418325\" data-src=\"/videos/blood-bowl-2-first-match/2300-6418325/\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe src=\"/videos/embed/6418325/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><blockquote><h4>\"Every turn has you organising the most important actions in your head, then recognising their probabilities.\"</h4></blockquote><p style=\"\">There are dice rolls for almost everything. Want to move out of a player’s tackle zone? Move a die. Want to pass the ball? Throw that die. Want to sprint an extra square? Run that die. Want to grind on a downed player’s throat to send him out of the match? Stamp on the die. Blocking is represented by throwing multiple dice depending on the player’s relative strengths, with the higher strength player allowed to pick the outcome from the dice. Fortunately, the game now tells you what the percentage chance of success is, rather than having to work it out yourself from basics.</p><p style=\"\">Given that the match engine is built on so much randomness, Blood Bowl is actually all about learning, positioning, and avoiding gambling until you have to. Even what seems like the most sure-fire action can result in a horrific failure. A three-dice block from a levelled-up strong player on a rookie should knock them down 95 percent of the time, but that small chance of the veteran going down does crop up, and you have to play knowing that.</p><p style=\"\">Any failure, however minor, means a turnover, where control switches to the opponent. So, if players are unlucky enough to fail their first action every turn then the game can be over very quickly, but a game between two players who know what they’re doing, who only take calculated risks, can last more than half an hour.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2940524-9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2940524\" data-ratio=\"0.62510187449063\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2940524-9.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1544/15443861/2940524-9.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Almost every team has a Big Guy ­ a slow, hard­-hitting lynchpin.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Every turn has you organising the most important actions in your head, then recognising their probabilities. You always move your players into covering and supporting positions first, if possible. Sometimes you don’t do things just because a small chance of failure is enough to ruin your plan entirely. Let’s say you have a three-dice block lined up which would likely result in an injury, which would give you a numerical advantage in later turns. But you have also have a ball-carrier standing near the enemy scoring zone with enemy players just a few steps behind them. Here, you play the ball, not the man. Scoring is the most important thing, and only when you’re way ahead can you afford to gamble.</p><p style=\"\">Unless, of course, you’re a team that plays the man, not the ball, like the high strength Chaos team or the block skill-heavy Dwarf team. The aim of these guys is to be as close with as many players as possible, get them on the floor, then stamp on them when they’re down. Even with the average human team, I played games where I knocked out almost the entire opposing team and just ran the ball to the touchline each turn.</p><p style=\"\">That’s the joy of Blood Bowl, the way that the slightly different stats, costs, skills, and levelling path of each team member will result in huge team differences that play out in every action. The extra point of strength that a Black Orc has over a normal Orc means that he’ll normally be attacking with two dice instead of one, which hugely increases his chance of success.</p><blockquote><h4>\"Even with the average human team, I played games where I knocked out almost the entire opposing team and just ran the ball to the touchline each turn.\"</h4></blockquote><p style=\"\">Developer Cyanide has improved the game substantially since its previous iteration, renovating the terrible UI and making it much more understandable and user-friendly. New elements like the Cabalvision preview let you see what will happen with your current action should you choose to go ahead with it. There are still problems, however. It seems to take ages to block an opponent, as you pick the target, confirm the block, roll the dice, choose whether to re-roll, pick a single die from your roll, pick the direction that the opponent will be pushed, choose whether your player will follow up, and finally have to watch a short unskippable cutscene of the block. In a turn you might do several of these blocks, which is why there’s a timer to restrict the turn to four minutes.</p><p style=\"\">Though the individual games are important and enjoyable, it’s the league modes where the game really comes to life. These are single-player or online multiplayer, with a wide management model (now including stadium upgrades) and handicapping to balance weak teams against strong ones. Every difficult action in the match game (scoring, passing, injuring) gives XP to your players, and as they level you get a choice of random upgrades to customise them. My chaos team’s Minotaur got a mutation that replaced his left hand with an enormous claw, massively increasing his chances of injuring people.</p><p style=\"\">Injuries or deaths in a single game are just annoyances, because they can take key players out of your team for the rest of the match. A permanent injury can also render a player effectively useless; who wants a slow catcher or a half-blind thrower? But in the campaign mode, replacing a dead or crippled player can be horribly expensive. Teams with low armour, like the agile Skaven or the Wood Elves, are especially prone to this, but even tough teams regularly lose players.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\"

comprehensible and matches easier to arrange. They’ve introduced ageing into the league modes, so that teams really do change over time, meaning you can’t rely on that star player always being there. The new online transfer market is a bit more of a gamble (see <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-iii-review/1900-6414230/\">Diablo III</a>); there were no players listed in the review version so we’re not sure how well it’s going to work. But the new live streaming and replay integration (under the name Cabalvision) is a very welcome touch.</p><p style=\"\">This version also introduces a single-player campaign mode, which was the most egregious absence from the earlier games. You’re the new coach of the Reikland Reavers, the most famous human team, which has fallen on hard times. Most of them have been killed, their two-star players are in hiding, and a strange new sponsor is manipulating them behind the scenes. Through the long campaign you’ve got to recover the team’s fanbase and standing, rebuild the team from a bunch of rookies, recover your star players, and discover what the nefarious plot is that threatens the team every match.</p><p style=\"\">You can really tell that Cyanide has put a huge amount of work into this, from the gorgeous animations throughout, to the gentle humour of the two commentators, to the sheer length of the story. Many missions have surprise events that happen partway through, or tough victory conditions that you have to achieve, as well as winning the game. The AI teams still make stupid mistakes and behave irrationally but, hey, that’s the current state of AI.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2940527-6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2940527\" data-ratio=\"0.62510187449063\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2940527-6.jpg\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1544/15443861/2940527-6.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1544/15443861/2940527-6.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>When playing against higher value teams, handicaps are enforced.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The campaign mode also doubles as a tutorial, which again was a terrible absence from the earlier Blood Bowls, where each match unlocks a new aspect of the game. For new players, the campaign is a gentle (if long) introduction, after which they’ll need to start reading tactics sites like <a href=\"http://bbtactics.com/\">bbtactics.com</a> to get ready for online play. By the time a new player is halfway through the campaign, you’ll be able to play the basic game as well as many veterans, though you won’t have the required deep stats knowledge about the chances of every action until you’ve played for weeks. One suspects that this kind of data memorisation will definitely appeal to DOTA and LOL players in search of a new challenge.</p><p style=\"\">Though Blood Bowl's interface has improved substantially since the previous game, we still have some quibbles. Not everyone will get on with the strange rotating camera zoom. It would be great to speed up the opponent’s turn, or indeed all player actions, because games do take much longer than they should considering how little happens. And, like the Blood Bowl Star Coach game (which died in beta) the option to automate your team members a little, and remove some of the drudge work involved in blocking, would be welcome.</p><p style=\"\">What will annoy Blood Bowl players more is if the DLC strategy replicates the previous game's. The previous Blood Bowl was released in three full-price versions, adding a small number of teams each time. Players who’ve pre-ordered Blood Bowl II already had to choose between the Lizardmen and Wood Elf teams as a bonus unlock, which suggests the other will only be available for a price. Although Blood Bowl II already has a relatively robust line-up, there are many popular teams which are still missing from this version, such as the Halflings, Underworld, Nurgle, and Chaos Dwarf teams.</p><p style=\"\">For a French recreation of a British board game pastiching an American hobby, Blood Bowl 2 is remarkably coherent. Perhaps if Cyanide had stuck less rigorously to the board game and streamlined some of the processes, then they’d have made a better video game too, albeit one that could have alienated their hardcore fanbase. Yet overall, Blood Bowl 2 is a step forward. It's a much friendlier, easier game than its predecessors, with improved looks, a tutorial campaign, controller support, and the UI improvements. New players won't feel blocked off from enjoying it.</p>",

            "description": "<p style=\"\">Football!</p><p style=\"\">With that note of excitement hanging in the air, allow me a moment of clarity. FIFA is a tough game to review. It's an aggregation of several years’ worth of features and modes, all of which are changed and updated to varying degrees with each iteration. Anyone who’s played FIFA, or PES, or any sports game will know, it’s impossible to <i>really </i>know how you feel about that game until you’ve played it for months; Loved it, hated it, loved it again, and then decided it’s, you know, alright for a game you’ve played for 300 hours.</p><p style=\"\">With that in mind I intend to limit this review to a look at two crucial things that have changed in FIFA 16, which are: the addition of a new Draft mode within the extraordinarily successful FIFA Ultimate Team; and, well, <i>everything</i>.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-6427056\" data-src=\"/videos/fifa-16-drafted-team-gameplay/2300-6427056/\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe src=\"/videos/embed/6427056/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p style=\"\">We should probably start with ‘everything’, as there’s a lot to get through. What I mean by ‘everything’ is that the heart of the game, the way in which FIFA plays football, has for the first time in a few years made a jump big enough to feel like a distinct break rather than an iterative polish. Last year’s slants and foibles--pace, over-the-top through-balls, maddening defender behaviour--have been taken sternly in hand, to the extent that playing <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/fifa-16/\">FIFA 16</a> feels like learning a new game. It’s hard, and the first few games are a mixture of frustration and promise.</p><p style=\"\">The stated objective was to remove player speed as the pivotal factor in deciding games, to make the midfield meaningful, and to enable different styles of play, rather than <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fifa-15-review/1900-6415879/\">FIFA 15</a>’s dominating tactic of high balls out to the wing where fast man will get behind the defence. EA Sports' latest soccer sim wants players to compete on a level footing. And while, realistically, we’ll have to wait until the online population has stress-tested the new system for millions of hours and reported back before we’ll really know, this is how the changes currently feel.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2916868-fut16_packitems_asset_higher-resolution.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2916868\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a href=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2916868-fut16_packitems_asset_higher-resolution.png\"><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1365/13658182/2916868-fut16_packitems_asset_higher-resolution.jpg\"></a><figcaption>FIFA 16's Ultimate Team now also comes with a compelling new Draft Mode </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Defending is easier.

Slide tackles have regained some of the old potency; players really do slide again, meaning it’s possible to win the ball from unexpected distance. Well-timed toe-pokes, meanwhile, can satisfyingly break up play, while desperate moments give players more options to deliberately foul players just before they break into space (this is usually harshly punished, but so much fun). I’ve been caught by defenders when I thought I was out of range, I’ve won the ball with crunching block-tackles at fullback, and I’ve used the slide to channel runners by blocking off their path. This new, stronger, more flexible slide tackling is a success.</p><p style=\"\">Other noticeable additions to defending include a tackle feint, for counter-baiting tricksy opponents during one-on-one battles. No longer does the protect-the-ball crab pose offer an impenetrable defence; it’s easier to slip around players in possession of the ball and then get a foot to it. Perhaps most significantly of all, defender AI has been fine-tuned to make more interceptions and to track runners with more doggedness.</p><p style=\"\">These last points are the ones that really contribute to FIFA 16’s most obvious shift; the fact that the midfield is now a battlefield. Working the ball through the middle of the park feels attritional and muddy, full of physicality and friction. More than ever, it’s a game of inches and interceptions, with defenders urging themselves towards the ball wherever possible, pressing and lunging and reaching out feet. It can get scrappy, with miscontrols and turnovers spilling messily around for a few seconds at a time, but it feels like an organic sort of mess, a footballing mess.</p><figure data-align=\"center\"

midfield an even fight, if an asymmetrical one. No-touch dribbling adds another layer to the game’s skill system, enabling players to duck and feint over the ball, looking to send defenders the wrong way. This is pretty but so far, for me, not hugely effective; I rarely had enough space in-field to dance over the ball, and on the wings I went for reliable old step-overs. But more integral is the new precision passing system, which effectively introduces a hard, pinged pass that can be pulled off by holding R1 (RB). It’s clearly been designed as a foil to the stickier, interception-prone midfield, and it comes with an element of risk and skill. Lesser players are more likely to fumble these stinging passes, and judging angles, ability and distance adds a new dimension to the basics of FIFA’s play.</p><p style=\"\">The result of all of this is that FIFA 16 is full of scrappy back and forth, the ability to play patient possession football, and a greater range of passing than ever. The dominance of pace in last year's game is over, although sometimes it does seem as though it has been offed through foul means, with through-balls, for instance, feeling conspicuously limited, unwilling to put players in the clear either up the lines or over the top of defences. But for the most part the new style of play--slower, grittier, but still skilled--seems like it’s been achieved through nurturing rather than nerfing.</p><p style=\"\">And so that is everything, in terms of its gameplay pillars, which no doubt is the area on which I place the most importance when judging FIFA. But FIFA’s success during the last few years has been as much to do with the collecting and trading compulsions of Ultimate Team as it’s been about actual (pretend) football. So the arrival of Draft mode, a significant addition to Ultimate Team, is also worth a good look.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2940512-fifa-16-womens-international-teams.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2940512\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2940512-fifa-16-womens-international-teams.jpg\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1544/15443861/2940512-fifa-16-womens-international-teams.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1544/15443861/2940512-fifa-16-womens-international-teams.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>For the first time, FIFA 16 features women's international teams. </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Draft mode sits aside from the main business of buying packs, building teams, and playing them against opposition online. It’s like a paid-entry one-off Ultimate Team tournament, in which players build a temporary team position by position, opening a pack for every slot and deciding which player inside best fits the side under construction. The finished team is then played against other Draft players, with bigger than usual coin rewards for a winning run (the maximum streak is four wins).</p><p style=\"\">Putting aside the longstanding misgivings about how Ultimate Team commodifies the magic of football, and how it sort of encourages kids to gamble, it’s great. Draft takes the pleasure of building a team--piecing together strong chemistry, the thrill of opening packs--and gives it to you without the need to pull your main team apart. It costs 15,000 coins (or 300 microtransaction FIFA points) to enter, and <i>of course </i>Draft mode is, in the end, about making more money. But that’s OK if it’s something worth paying for, and Draft offers something more substantial than the chance to simply reveal a randomised selection of players. Building a new team is a complex puzzle that’s different with each Draft, and winning a few games delivers substantial rewards (my first four-game winning streak gave me a total return of around 60,000 coins, which is a fine start to the season).</p><p style=\"\">FIFA needed a year like this. Without serious competition from Konami’s PES in the past few years (<a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pes-2016-review/1900-6416240/\">until now</a>), and with Ultimate Team keeping players playing and paying all year round, there’s been no pressing motivation to ring the changes. Annual titles will always evolve gradually, but recent progress has felt glacial. FIFA 16 can be stubborn and stifling, but it feels gloriously <i>new</i>, and having to learn fresh strategies and nuances in a game series like this is an almost-forgotten pleasure.</p>",

            "description": "<p style=\"\">The Taken King is more than just an expansion; it's also a heart transplant. And with its wounds sewn shut, the anesthetic wearing off, and the scalpels put away to dry, Destiny has pulled through the operation with renewed vigor and a much stronger pulse. Now, only a few scars remain.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Destiny's first year was a collage of peaks and valleys as Bungie released two expansions to its sci-fi multiplayer title. At its best, Destiny comprised a shooter with pristine controls and clever cooperative play. But at its worst, Destiny disrespected my time. To me, the first year of Destiny felt empty. Its gorgeous worlds held promise, but lacked much of a soul. I frequented those static environments because no matter how boring they might have felt, they contained the slim promise of better loot. I continued long past the point of actually having fun.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576751/2940372-destiny-the-taken-king-echo-chamber-screen-03-us-16jun15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2940372\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576751/2940372-destiny-the-taken-king-echo-chamber-screen-03-us-16jun15.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1557/15576751/2940372-destiny-the-taken-king-echo-chamber-screen-03-us-16jun15.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Destiny's newest strikes are among its most creative.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">But The Taken King changes things. Now, my time is better spent. Bungie revamped the Light, loot, and experience systems to be more accessible, and provide a more rewarding overall experience. Light is no longer tied to specific armor pieces, but just an average of your gear's overall value. Raising it is necessary for difficult missions, but when it comes to your rank, you can reach the level 40 cap through experience alone. And now that loot scales with your level, the promise of better gear is always on the horizon, encouraging constant improvement and rewarding results.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">By decoupling Light and character level, Destiny allows you to play however you want, regardless of which missions you want to play, or how often you want to play them. In Destiny's first year, only certain events were worth pursuing for better gear. But now, much of the loot is out there, somewhere in the solar system, waiting for you to stumble upon it. You can fight through cooperative strikes, explore Mars, or turn in bounties for added experience. You can summon a plethora of challenging bosses in the Court of Oryx, a public event area teeming with Guardians in search of gear.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The Dreadnaught itself, an abandoned ship in the rings of Saturn, is full of secrets, hidden items, quest chains and more. It's an area worth exploring, and sets the stage for The Taken King's exceptional narrative.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576751/2940373-cayde6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2940373\" data-ratio=\"0.55555555555556\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576751/2940373-cayde6.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1557/15576751/2940373-cayde6.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Nathan Fillion's Cayde-6 delivers a phenomenal performance.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The new story missions follow our Guardians in their fight against Oryx, the Hive king whose looming shadow has darkened things since we killed his son in The Dark Below expansion. These story missions are coherent, providing much needed context to the quests our Guardians embark upon. I always knew the mission objective, and always felt the pull of that final battle with The Taken King at the end of the road.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">There's also more character here. The vanguard leaders are more than talking mannequins now, with personalities, motivations, and fears of their own. Nolan North delivers a stellar performance as your Ghost, but its Cayde-6, the Hunter leader, who stands out. Voiced by Nathan Fillion, his sarcasm and sardonic wit are just facades. They slowly give way to doubt and remorse when he learns of a friend's death. For the first time, Destiny transcends archetypes, and shows signs of humanity in its storytelling. It's ironic then, that Cayde-6 isn't human.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Fighting through these story missions is more varied than ever before. It's not just endless shooting at cookie cutter enemies. The Taken are ghostlike clones of Destiny's other enemy factions, which Oryx has absorbed into his own army, creating a force with a wide array of abilities and attacks. Fallen captains blind you, Cabal scions split into triplets, and Vex goblins shield their allies, forcing you to aim for one specific grunt at a time. Destiny's combat is more dynamic now, and more versatile than the skirmishes of its first year.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Strike bosses in The Taken King follow suit, and require teamwork and tactics to defeat. Among the best is The Restorative Mind. This Vex boss hidden in the depths of Venus is more than just a bullet sponge, and constant motion is the only way to lower its defenses. You'll need to drain its shield, protect your teammates, and fight through clusters of Vex in a ring-shaped arena. All of this is done on the AI's terms, though, as the boss rotates an impassable force field around the room, dictating the flow of combat and forcing snap decisions.</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\" data-align=\"center\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The Taken King transcends archetypes, and shows signs of humanity in its storytelling.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Bungie added even more variety to combat with the new subclasses, which change how I approach certain situations. Take my Hunter's Nightstalker option, for instance. By firing my bow into a cluster of enemies, I tether them together, marking a prime target for my Titan friend's Hammer of Sol, or the Warlock's chain lightning. It also makes every shot a critical hit, so using it at the right moment, on the right enemies, is part of the decision process. The subclasses don't just open new possibilities for character loadouts, but also encourage experimentation in cooperative matches.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The same rings true in the Crucible, Destiny's PvP arena. The subclasses aren't as balanced here--I reverted back to my Hunter's Golden Gun when the new subclass failed to produce--but they still alter the flow of combat on each new map. And these are among Bungie's best arenas, with varied sightlines and verticalities, offering hectic clash points amid the firefights. Once again, the developer has proven its prowess with multiplayer level design.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">And when you've gathered enough powerful gear, equipped your best weapons, and tailored your subclass to cooperative perfection, there's the new raid. It's called King's Fall, and it's the most expansive in Destiny to date. It begins on a sour note, with ill-advised first-person platforming that appears farther in as well. But everything else gathers speed. The checkpoints all require careful teamwork, and the bosses are some of the most creative Bungie has ever designed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Golgoroth is a prime example. On our tenth try, when muscle memory guided us through the fight's necessary tactics, this hulking ogre had a sliver of health left. We were almost through. And the moment before he died, when all six of us threw caution to the wind and unloaded everything we had, despite the Taken minions surrounding us--this is Destiny at its finest. Careful planning gave way to satisfying victory. And I don't want to spoil too much about the trek's latter stages, but its final boss, both in size and scope, is colossal. He's a fitting end to Destiny's most dynamic raid yet.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576751/2940375-screenshot-hunter-1.0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2940375\" data-ratio=\"0.55522740696988\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576751/2940375-screenshot-hunter-1.0.jpg\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1557/15576751/2940375-screenshot-hunter-1.0.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1557/15576751/2940375-screenshot-hunter-1.0.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Hunter's Nightstalker subclass creates useful tethers for for cooperative situations.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">But despite all of the improvements to Destiny's systems, all of the new content in place with The Taken King, and all of the heart that's gone into its compelling storyline, remnants of Destiny's hollow past still endure.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">After 16 hours with the expansion, the grind began.

            "description": "<p style=\"\">While <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/soma/\">SOMA</a> may have been dubbed a spiritual successor to the terrifying <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/amnesia-the-dark-descent/\">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a>, it would be reductive to simply call it a ‘science-fiction Amnesia’. For all its foreboding dread and ghastly creatures that go bump in the night, SOMA is driven more by an enigmatic narrative than any chilling moments of bloodcurdling terror.</p><p style=\"\">It’s a sophisticated and thoughtful game, with some grand, exciting, and frankly strange ideas, that proves to be a welcome sign of maturation for developer Frictional Games. It’s clear the Swedish developer isn't content to simply revisit well-trodden ground with another haunted house filled with ghouls and Lovecraftian horror, but instead eager to forge forward with something unpredictable and fresh. SOMA may not routinely rouse a quickened heartbeat, or cause beads of sweat to trickle down your forehead as regularly as Frictional's previous work, but it’s also all the better for it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Plunging deep into the murky depths below, your time with SOMA is spent in the water-logged boots of Simon Jarrett. How he ended up on this derelict subterranean research facility is just one of SOMA’s many mysteries; gradually revealed over the course of a story-driven experience that never stopped surprising me.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-6425229\" data-src=\"/videos/soma-e3-2015-trailer/2300-6425229/\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe src=\"/videos/embed/6425229/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The amount of high quality dialogue (in terms of both voice acting and writing), is one such delightful revelation, especially coming off the back of Frictional’s decidedly less garrulous work. Simon is certainly the talkative type, and though you may be trapped aboard a rotting undersea hulk, signs of life have not diminished entirely within these corroded metal halls just yet. Fairly early on you meet a woman named Catherine who keeps in semi-regular contact with you throughout the game. She represents a familiar voice in times of peril, but there’s also a sense of unease inherent in never quite knowing her true intentions. Nevertheless, the snappy back-and-forth between the two, and their budding relationship, forms the crux of SOMA’s storytelling, which meshes some surprisingly natural dark humour with more dramatic confrontations, and profound questions of both an ethical and philosophical nature.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938230-screen+shot+2015-09-16+at+18.19.45.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2938230\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.55954323001631\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938230-screen+shot+2015-09-16+at+18.19.45.png\"><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1544/15443861/2938230-screen+shot+2015-09-16+at+18.19.45.png\"></a><figcaption>SOMA compels you to interact with the world in all its mechanical and (slightly disturbing) organic forms.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Consciousness, suicide, the way we perceive our reality, and how we fit into the world are themes explored and handled with nuance throughout, displaying sympathy for those in need, and exhibiting the gallantry to question some of SOMA’s more outlandish science. How deep you want to tumble down this rabbit hole is entirely up to you, however. Simon and Catherine’s journey is deliberately-paced, ingraining a sense of urgency and momentum into proceedings that keeps you eagerly moving from moment to moment, no matter how ominous the path ahead may seem. But there are also palette cleansers, too, where you’re free to explore an environment and possibly uncover just what the hell happened here.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">A lot of SOMA’s horror arises from these instances; from the things that you don’t see. Where you come across grotesque scenes of things gone awry, and your imagination is free to run wild. Environmental details might fill in some of the blanks, and any corpses you find can be interacted with to reveal the final few seconds of a person’s life, lending SOMA’s irregular style of audio logs a sense of weight and intrigue. Notes scrawled on bits of paper strewn across someone’s desk may offer some insight, while most computers carry a few tidbits of backstory and information, if you’re willing to look.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Most of this is ancillary to the overarching narrative, but it feeds into a feeling that this facility was once bustling and full of life. A place worth living in, and thus a world worth building. It’s here where Frictional’s love of interactivity comes to life, as you grab, pick up and move objects, manually slide open doors, and pull down on levers until they clunk into place. SOMA’s retro-futuristic aesthetic lends functionality to these mechanics, making your presence within this world feel tangible. Computers breathe into life with a digital clatter and the whirring of fans, and SOMA’s various puzzles usually revolve around simply interacting and manipulating these various machines, gears, and clunky hardware. Again, it all helps to ground you in this world, where puzzles and story are intertwined to make gameplay and narrative feel like one cohesive whole, rather than separate entities. This breaks SOMA free from the shackles of Frictional’s past. Where Amnesia found a predictable rhythm of running, hiding, and then solving puzzles, SOMA’s progression feels more natural due to the underlying story seamlessly tying everything together.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938235-previewscreen_06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2938235\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938235-previewscreen_06.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1544/15443861/2938235-previewscreen_06.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Click on the thumbnails below to see more creepy screenshots</figcaption></figure><figure data-embed-type=\"gallery\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938237-pr_art_screen01.jpg,http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938238-previewscreen_02.jpg,http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938239-previewscreen_06.jpg,http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938240-previewscreen_08.jpg,http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938241-previewscreen_09.jpg,http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938242-previewscreen_10.jpg,http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938243-tool.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2938237,1300-2938238,1300-2938239,1300-2938240,1300-2938241,1300-2938242,1300-2938243\" data-resize-urls=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1544/15443861/2938237-pr_art_screen01.jpg,http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1544/15443861/2938238-previewscreen_02.jpg,http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1544/15443861/2938239-previewscreen_06.jpg,http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1544/15443861/2938240-previewscreen_08.jpg,http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1544/15443861/2938241-previewscreen_09.jpg,http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1544/15443861/2938242-previewscreen_10.jpg,http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1544/15443861/2938243-tool.jpg\" data-resized=\"\" data-resize-url=\"\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938237-pr_art_screen01.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1544/15443861/2938237-pr_art_screen01.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938238-previewscreen_02.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1544/15443861/2938238-previewscreen_02.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938239-previewscreen_06.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1544/15443861/2938239-previewscreen_06.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938240-previewscreen_08.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1544/15443861/2938240-previewscreen_08.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938241-previewscreen_09.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1544/15443861/2938241-previewscreen_09.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938242-previewscreen_10.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1544/15443861/2938242-previewscreen_10.jpg\"></a><a href=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938243-tool.jpg\" ><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/square_avatar/1544/15443861/2938243-tool.jpg\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">If it falters in any way, it’s when you begin to resemble a less-murderous <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-space-2-review/1900-6286854/\">Isaac Clarke</a>, with objectives regularly tasking you to fix things in order to pave the way forward. But even in these moments, when it teeters mightily close to the edge of predictability, it rarely feels like you’re doing the exact same thing twice. There’s always some variable or twist, and in SOMA's best moments, simply re-routing power may present a moral quandary or two to gnaw at your conscience.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Of course, there are still those occasions when you’re cowering in a corner; where the horror manifests itself in the hideous creatures that stalk and pursue you. It’s in these moments of isolation where the sound design really comes to life: all menacing growls, piercing shrieks, and something scurrying in the vents above. As ever, the fear of the unknown is often more terrifying than the blunt reality of coming face-to-face with your pursuer. Skulking the claustrophobic corridors of Pathos-II can be a test of your nerves. Whatever went wrong on this facility certainly left its mark, and the sense of dread is pervasive; etched into every nook and cranny.</p><blockquote data-align=\"right\"><h4 dir=\"ltr\">\"The fear of the unknown is often more terrifying than the blunt reality of coming face-to-face with your pursuer.\"</h4></blockquote><p style=\"\">Biomechanical growths cover the walls like an aggressive cancer, covered in barnacles and dripping with a thick, black substance. A similar affliction seems to have affected the semi-organic creatures that lurk in the shadows. From your first encounter with the bulbous and lumbering brute near the game’s outset, to a relentless aggressor in a decaying diving suit, SOMA’s enemy encounters may be few and far between, but they’re certainly memorable--if only for their forlorn visual design. No two creatures are alike, and figuring out how they act and react to your presence forms the basis of these unsettling confrontations.</p><p style=\"\">I found most of these interactions to be rather tedious affairs, however. As defenceless as you are, crouching and moving slowly proves to be the most effective tactic against these foes. When I was told not to look at one creature, I simply moved backwards. Meanwhile, a blind enemy who only reacted to sound merely made me especially careful not to bump into anything. These moments feel necessary to provide some adversity, and put a face to all the blinking lights and malfunctioning steam pipes, but I found myself clambering to get back to the story.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938232-screen+shot+2015-09-16+at+18.23.00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2938232\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.56301145662848\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2938232-screen+shot+2015-09-16+at+18.23.00.png\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1544/15443861/2938232-screen+shot+2015-09-16+at+18.23.00.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1544/15443861/2938232-screen+shot+2015-09-16+at+18.23.00.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Those with a fear of drowning, you have been warned.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The same rings true when you venture outside into the deep blue, where sound is muted, the sea floor is awash with strands of seaweed, and the rotting husks of disused metal and decomposing facilities. Sea life is the only thing still alive out here, as crabs scatter past your feet, and curious fish circle overhead. A sunken submarine may inspire awe, but I found these sea walks to be dull, plodding affairs. Despite appearances, they’re incredibly linear, shuffling you along from point A to point B with nothing all that interesting to see in between.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">These missteps of tedium shine a light on just how incredibly assured SOMA is elsewhere. I came in expecting something similar to Amnesia, just in a terrifying new location, but what I found is an intelligent game that forced me to think and contemplate ideas as only the best sci-fi is capable of doing. It may not stir the hordes of wailing YouTubers looking for the next best haunted house, but SOMA succeeds at crafting something much more meaningful in a genre that’s deserving of more than just simple jump scares.</p>",

The toys-to-life category may be becoming increasingly crowded, but in the always delicate dance between the commerce of pushing new toys and providing great gameplay, Skylanders' focus on providing variety and fun is, admirably, holding fast.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-6426267\" data-src=\"/videos/skylanders-superchargers-dragon-spine-and-chompy-g/2300-6426267/\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe src=\"/videos/embed/6426267/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Of course, it's still very much about those shiny new toys, a fact the little ones in your life won't let you soon forget. This year adds vehicles to the mix, and there are are three types: air, land, and sea. You get a land vehicle in SuperChargers starter pack (along with two Skylanders), which will be enough to get you through the main story content in the game. You will, of course, be locked out of any content requiring a sea or air vehicle, and with an air/sea challenge prominently placed within each level of the game (along with a mouthy denizen of the Skylands pleading with you to complete it), the in-game push to buy new toys can sometimes feel a little heavy.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">There are two upsides to this, however. The first is that the land vehicle sections are, by a long stretch, the best to play out of the three types. There are straight up <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-8/1900-6415760/\">Mario Kart</a>-like racing sections that provide a great sense of speed and chaos, with wide tracks, boost pads, collectibles, and branching paths that are a joy to speed through. Occasionally, you'll have to slow the pace down and drive around large arenas, taking on foes and environmental obstacles. In fact, some of the best boss battles in Skylanders take place when you're driving a land vehicle. One sequence had us (my six-year-old son \"drove\" while I controlled weapons) chasing a villain in a large airship, dodging mines and firing upon drones in a kinetic display of explosions and flying debris. Another boss fight had me using portals to warp from one large platform to another, chasing down another baddie who flitted from area to area.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The other upside is somewhat more loaded, however. While there's a noticeable in-game push for the new vehicle types, previous locked levels based on Skylander elements seem to have disappeared almost entirely. No longer will you come across areas that only specific elemental Skylanders can open. The kid pestering will be all about getting an air or sea vehicle, and considering that buying one of each type allows you to access all of those levels within the game, this will probably prove to be less of a headache for parents (like me) who are budget conscious (like me).</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2900337-ssc_dark+edition_dark+stealth+elf+2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2900337\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2900337-ssc_dark+edition_dark+stealth+elf+2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1197/11970954/2900337-ssc_dark+edition_dark+stealth+elf+2.jpg\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">If you do end up spending the extra cash for sea or air vehicles, then the gameplay that's here is enjoyable enough that it won't be a regrettable decision. Both sea and air vehicles feature racing sections and arena-like battles, and each comes with interesting nuances that make them unique. Sea vehicles, for example, can dive underwater, forcing you to look for shortcuts or items underneath the waves. And all three vehicle types control remarkably well--experienced gamers won't have any troubles getting their heads around the controls, but it's notable just how well some of the touches here make it a more accessible game for younger players. Wide tracks that allow for plenty of error is just the start--everything from the sensitivity of vehicle handling to the stickiness of targeting is well calibrated to suit junior gamers.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">While the vehicles adds the most visible \"new\" element to Skylanders, there's plenty more here that expand upon the series' traditional action adventure (with a little puzzle solving) formula. Nearly every level and area you'll explore in Skylanders comes with a unique gameplay twist. One level screws around with gravity, forcing you to navigate your characters along walls and ceilings. Another introduces a Star Wars-like Force push/pull mechanic, while another arms you with a shrink/growth ray to mess around with. Each of the mechanics are wonderfully integrated within their own distinct areas, with puzzles, enemies, and even vehicle challenges all requiring you to tinker with said mechanics in different ways. In the shrink/growth ray section, for example, shrinking some enemies makes them less of a threat, while using the growth ray on another enemy's weapon may cause them to topple under the weight. There's even, for the first time in the series, online multiplayer races that you can take your vehicles on. These are fun, if not ever reaching the competitive highs of dedicated racers like Mario Kart. Skylanders Superchargers is a game that seems reluctant to stand still, and is constantly offering up interesting new challenges.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/225/2256286/2940139-ssc_mp+land+racing+1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2940139\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/225/2256286/2940139-ssc_mp+land+racing+1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_small/225/2256286/2940139-ssc_mp+land+racing+1.jpg\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Perhaps the only thing that's stayed the same from previous versions is the consistent high quality of the physical, real-world toys of Skylanders Superchargers. As with previous games, placing a toy on the game's physical portal (and the game still accepts all of the older generation Skylander toys) places it within the game world for you to play with. The level of detail on the toys remains impressive, and the vehicles (which often have moving parts like wheels or propellers) are similarly well built. If you're playing on a Wii U, the Nintendo-exclusive figurines double as amiibo, and are some of the best in the new series of toys (Bowser is wonderfully detailed). My litmus test for the appeal of these toys has always been whether my son will play with them even without the game turned on, and sure enough, I've seen him on more than one occasion running down hapless Skylanders with a vehicle. Test passed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Skylanders, too, continues to pass as one of the best kid-friendly games out there, and thankfully, it's appeal doesn't stop at puberty. Skylanders SuperChargers is a fast-paced affair, never lingering in one spot for too long, always offering something new and fun to do. It's a great game to play with kids, and one grown ups shouldn't be ashamed to try.</p><p style=\"\"> </p>",

            "description": "<p style=\"\">It’s a strange thing to know that you’re powerless. As the realization dawns, possibilities and options fall away, leaving you with one inevitable conclusion. While wave after wave of my bombers streak across the sky, I have to imagine that my opponent is feeling helpless. When the bombers drop their payload, it will mark my sixth consecutive multiplayer victory using the same tactic. But the more I play, the more I’ve come to realize that Act of Aggression builds itself on these moments. Each player probes his or her foes, poking for weaknesses before they inexorably find one. But even then, the end comes slowly, and the loser has time to reflect on what went wrong.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">On paper, Act of Aggression isn’t that different from any other RTS. You have three basic functions that represent the three core tactics these sorts of games have always had: one for rushing an enemy before they can get themselves established, one for building up defenses until you can wait for superior (albeit more expensive) technology to overwhelm your foes, and one that’s a balance of the two. You gather resources, build bases, train units, and gain control of territory. None of this is new, and Act of Aggression doesn’t handle these ideas in any novel or particularly interesting ways. What makes Act of Aggression special is its rhythm.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939745-aoa2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2939745\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939745-aoa2.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2939745-aoa2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Base layout and management is of the utmost importance.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Each match begins with a core base and one scouting unit. Pretty standard so far. Immediately, though, the formula begins to diverge. Because there's no central location where you'll find all the resources you need, nor any way to build out your base with larger and larger shells as in Age of Empires, you're forced to do things a little differently. First I'd rush with lightly armed troops, stretching out with vulnerable tendrils grabbing what I could. Then I'd hunker down and secure the position with big guns and long-term emplacements. Both of these tactics are common in other games, but here they are essential, and it means that outposts need to be self-sufficient.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Play, then, revolves around poking your opponents' units and buildings to see if they've been careless, to see what they've neglected. Any position can be overwhelmed with enough force, but if you're playing well you'll often spread yourself a bit too thin to secure everything. This makes for an interesting twist on the usual pattern of strategy game play, and one that always left me uneasy. I never felt safe or secure-- was always pushing and always repelling. By itself, that pattern of play is remarkable. It's exhilarating, and I found myself challenging my own tried and true tactics and algorithms I'd built and refined after years of competitive strategy gaming. But it doesn't take long for cracks to start showing in that veneer.</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\" data-align=\"center\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The first and by far the biggest problem Act of Aggression faces is that achieving a level of fluency</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The first and by far the biggest problem Act of Aggression faces is that achieving a level of fluency, where play is comprehensible and more importantly manageable, takes some work. As yet, there's no proper tutorial, and the campaign follows some of the worst tropes of its genre. Act of Aggression locks units, buildings, and ideas behind arbitrary walls, only revealing them for isolated lessons that don't teach you how to use these tools and adapt to new challenges. Instead it holds you to a strict path without being able to explore the potential of its own design. If anything, I found that finishing the campaign left me worse off when it came time to square with others. That's exacerbated by abysmal voice work and a cliché plot torn straight from the pages of a Clancy novel.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Even when you do familiarize yourself with the proceedings, Act of Aggression bogs itself down with unnecessary fluff. Your typical battle will have you working with twenty or more buildings, for example, most of which look so similar that it's hard to keep each of them straight. It leads to odd situations where you'll build a \"light vehicle\" factory that can also make some of the strongest attack copters in the game, long before you have access to the ostensibly helicopter-centric \"helipad.\" That'd be excusable, of course, if the latter building was strictly better, but I only used it once.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939764-aoa3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2939764\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939764-aoa3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2939764-aoa3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A broad range of multiplayer options keeps you engaged in ways the campaign fails to.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">This is a complaint that runs throughout. Some units have niches so specific that it's a wonder their role wasn't condensed into something simpler. Yes, options are generally a great idea, but in a game that already struggles with a clean and effective user interface, this manifests as another frustration. It gives the impression that most of the game could have been condensed. It complicates affairs without adding anything of value into the mix.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Act of Aggression's user interface is similarly overwrought. The expand-hold-expand structure encourages waging several small battles across multiple fronts at once, but there's no persistent indication of where you need to direct your attention. There is a ticker in the upper-left hand corner of the screen, but clicking those notifications doesn't auto-snap to the event the game describes. It often led me to lose track of threats and left me ill-informed about the status of the battlefield. Despite these problems, Act of Aggression manages to find legs in multiplayer matches. In my time with the game, I played more than a dozen rounds with a bevy of opponents and each was an exhilarating slugfest.</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\" data-align=\"center\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Despite these problems, Act of Aggression manages to find legs in multiplayer matches.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Keeping to the rhythm I described earlier, I'd start by reaching out for critical points on the map and lock myself down, waiting for my foes' nascent probes. Countless times we'd start firefights that lasted the rest of the game. Banks--neutral buildings that provide a steady, constant stream of income to any player that holds them--were particularly contentious. When infantry takes refuge in a bank, they're well-defended, making them a difficult target for opposing soldiers to capture. Even with plenty of support, wresting an established foothold near a bank is almost impossible. Yet, the cost was low enough and the reward high enough to incentivize a constant, smoldering conflict.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">When one of us did start to crack, though, it took time to restructure our war efforts and finish the job. And that's the biggest oddity here. For all of its speed, for all of its, well, aggression, the final moments of any given match are typically quiet. Even when players start wielding the earth-shattering super weapons, countermeasures are easy to deploy. Again, it means that you're waiting to find the one thing your opponent never considered, the one thing they ignored or thought they could do without if only for a little while.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939766-aoa1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2939766\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939766-aoa1.jpg\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2939766-aoa1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2939766-aoa1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Station troops inside of buildings to fortify choke points and help gather resources.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">These kinds of games don't exist anymore. For better or worse, Act of Aggression isn't from this decade. It opens with riotous bombast backed with haughty metal riffs and maintains a jubilant, adolescent tone throughout. It's rough, it's incomplete, it's awful in places. But it's also raw and decadent. Soaked to the core in that quintessentially nineties cocktail of cynicism and an exultant love of violence, playing Act of Aggression feels like going back in time and returning to a home that only exists in your oldest memories. And that's special, even if it means dealing with some obtuse design issues.</p><p style=\"\"> </p>",

            "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Shadowrun, as a universe, is already a great marriage of two very separate, very Western fantasy scenarios; one part D&amp;D-inspired elves-and-dwarves witchcraft and wizardry, one part William Gibson-brand gritty, street-level cyberpunk. The series has done a fantastic job exploring both of these aspects through several games now, but with Shadowrun: Hong Kong, the series adopts an Eastern flavor, incorporating a classic facet of the cyberpunk genre for the first time in its nearly 30 year tenure.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The change-up is welcome, in part because not much else about Shadowrun has changed since 2013’s well-received Shadowrun Returns. The focus in Shadowrun Hong Kong is exactly where it belongs, and that’s on the storytelling. Narrative, character development, and world-building are king here. The plotting is a little uninspiring: You’re an ex-con, recently released, now trying to make an honest living in Seattle, when you get a call from your estranged foster father to return to China. Not even five minutes after stepping onto Chinese soil, you find out your foster father is missing, presumed dead, and there’s an APB out to arrest you, your brother, and anyone seen with you that evening. And by “arrest,” of course, they mean “brutally murder on sight.”</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939732-shadowrunhk4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2939732\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.56222547584187\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939732-shadowrunhk4.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2939732-shadowrunhk4.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Just when you thought it was safe to walk down a back alley alone again.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">So begins the tale of how you became a Shadowrunner, a member of the vast, unstoppable network of scrappy cybercriminal underdogs fighting the questionably good fight against the cabal of mega corporations running the world’s lower classes even deeper into the dirt. In another universe, this could very easily be the futuristic brother of Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, yet another tale of a low-level underling killing their way into the mantle of boss in the name of revenge, just with the twist of being able to create your own character out of the multiple fantasy races and RPG classes offered at the outset. For occasionally long swaths of the game, that’s exactly what it is. But Shadowrun has far too weighty a pedigree to make it that simple.</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\" data-align=\"center\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The focus in Shadowrun Hong Kong is exactly where it belongs, and that’s on the storytelling.</p></blockquote><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939733-shadowrunhk6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2939733\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.56222547584187\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939733-shadowrunhk6.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_small/1406/14063904/2939733-shadowrunhk6.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Asking me to be your right hand man? Oh, no, ma’am, I’ve played Streets of Rage.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Most of your time in Shadowrun is spent playing it strictly as a point-and-click adventure, running messy errands for your Triad boss, a badass old buzzard named Kindly Cheng. Missions involve no small amount of investigation, collecting clues from crime scenes, interviewing eyewitnesses, organizing thefts, making back-alley deals for information, negotiating trades and delivering messages, in ink or blood, to the worst brand of scumbag on the planet.When words won’t do the trick—though quite often, they can—you turn to the sword. The turn-based isometric gameplay of Shadowrun: Hong Kong’s predecessors is back, unchanged, and things get tense and brutal from the very first fight, when two potential allies take a bullet to the head before you even remember their names. It’s actually a bit unforgiving for folks jumping into the series for the first time, which is a possibility, considering this is a complete disconnect story-wise from the previous titles. The “surely, you’ve done this before” expectation is jarring when you get thrown in at the deep end.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">There’s a small tutorial for basic combat, and anyone who’s played XCOM will pick up on things quickly; it’s more or less the same system, with some melee combat and magical summoning thrown in for good measure. Combat puts you on an invisible grid, with each character in your crew free to attack, heal, move around a specified distance each turn at the cost of Ability Points the more elaborate the maneuver. The mix of fantasy and cyberpunk comes into play here too. A shotgun-wielding orc might find himself facing off against a human casting a fire spell, providing a distraction so a katana-wielding samurai can slip behind the enemy and get critical melee damage. Winning depends entirely on tactical prowess, getting characters to cover, getting damage bonuses for flanking, slowing your enemies before they even manage to get their turn. The reward, regardless: money and Karma points, which can be spent upgrading your main character’s abilities.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939734-shadowrunhk3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2939734\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.56222547584187\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939734-shadowrunhk3.jpg\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2939734-shadowrunhk3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2939734-shadowrunhk3.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Matrix has you…</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Even then, it’s both blessing and curse that, more often than not, you’re spending your time reading and talking to NPCs rather than killing street punks and corporate stooges. Many of the game’s missions involve making your Shadowrunner talk their way out of a situation instead of fighting their way out.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">It wouldn’t be cyberpunk without some measure of hacking, however, and the Matrix-- the system by which Shadowrunners can hack into computer systems—does fill a little bit of the gap there for action, though not necessarily in the most accessible and enjoyable of ways. It’s an isometric stealth mini-game, essentially, where your avatar in the Matrix must sneak past security systems to get to a specific node of information or a killswitch for a computer system. The actual gameplay in these sections is given a quick splash screen explanation, and then you’re on your own. It gets easier once you level up, but the game is notoriously stingy with the Karma points required to do so, even after the game’s most hectic fights. It’s almost universally better figuring out the non-hacking alternative, of which one always exists.</p><blockquote data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The turn-based isometric gameplay of Shadowrun: Hong Kong’s predecessors is back, unchanged, and things get tense and brutal from the very first fight.</p></blockquote><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939736-shadowrunhk2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2939736\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.56222547584187\" data-width=\"320\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939736-shadowrunhk2.jpg\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_small/1406/14063904/2939736-shadowrunhk2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_small/1406/14063904/2939736-shadowrunhk2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Saints Row: Orc Out Of Hell</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">It might seem counter-intuitive for a game trying to be engaging for 15–20 hours not to break up the reading with a fight--and without a doubt, to some people, that’s exactly what may happen--but not when the writing is this good. Evil men and women will often earn pity or at least grudging respect, and you are given the options through dialogue to respond to those emotions in kind. Mysteries often have several alternative solutions, depending on who you talk to and just how down and dirty you want to get. Sometimes, it’s worth talking to an NPC just to hear their story. Much of the playtime depends less on how many side missions you take on, and more on how much time you spend getting to know the people around you, even though it’s possible you may never meet them again. Fleeting as these interactions may be, they offer some of the best storytelling moments in the game. One of my favorites is told by an Irish elf who leaves their faction to create a new Tir Na Nog--a realm of eternal youth. Her purpose is really just to hand you a key to a sewer, and yet I spent 10 minutes chatting with her about her dealings with the new IRA, and how some of the creatures of Irish legend happen to be real.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The story streamlines after some time when the real plot presents itself, though this introduces a scary new element of the citizenry of Hong Kong all experiencing the same terrifying nightmare, and falling victim to homicidal insanity. It uses Chinese myth and spirituality in an interesting way, albeit with a few predictable elements. Players who have already taken this trip with Shadowrun Returns and its expansion may find themselves wanting a bit with the gameplay, and newbies will have quite the learning curve to surmount, but if you see the gameplay as an adequate means to experience the more satisfying narrative end, Shadowrun: Hong Kong more than earns your attention.</p>",

            "description": "<p style=\"\">My Japanese cruiser charged onward, bravely facing the surrounding maelstrom. A friendly battleship to my left billowed black smoke, its deck burning with red-orange fire as dogfighting planes buzzed overhead. To my right, I spotted an enemy cruiser several kilometers away; I lined up my guns and fired a salvo of high-explosive rounds, striking the ship and knocking out one of its primary batteries. Alas, my celebration over the successful shot was cut short by a blaring alarm indicating oncoming fire; an enemy battleship just beyond a small island had taken notice of me, sending a volley of ordnance my way. My next move could be my last.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">World of Warships is a thrilling, free-to-play multiplayer action game, where you command a World War II-era ship through troubled waters. Slugs of white-hot metal tear through the sky, threatening to turn you or one of your allies’ ships into scrap . You must constantly be wary of deadly torpedoes as you circle islands and glaciers--turning hard at the helm to avoid gunfire--and keep from getting beached in the process.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939159-0005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2939159\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939159-0005.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2939159-0005.jpg\"></a><figcaption>It's almost too pretty here to start a fight here.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The intensity of online battles is matched by the incredible variety of ships at your disposal. Dozens watercraft are available to unlock and upgrade. You begin with a small selection of lighter ships in the first tier, but soon, faster and more powerful vessels are made available. Fans of naval history will get a kick out of the impressive gathering of famous ships from the navies of both the United States and Japan. There are ten tiers to explore, most of which are categorized among four classes: destroyers, cruisers, battleships, and aircraft carriers. Destroyers are the weakest in the group, yet also the fastest, making their ability to charge by and launch a handful of torpedoes terrifying; battleships are the muscle of the fleet, heavily armored and heavily gunned; and cruisers sit somewhere in the middle, with decent firepower and armor--some (quite a few on the Japanese side) also equipped with torpedo launchers.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Unlike the other vessels, commanding an aircraft carrier requires that you know more than just maneuvering and shooting. In fact, the game seems to know this as well, since you’re unable to unlock a carrier until you have reached at least tier four. As a carrier, you play most of the match using the tactical map. Almost akin to a real-time strategy game, you build aircraft of varying types--from fighters to bombers to torpedo planes--and send them off to support allies and damage (or destroy!) enemies. It’s quite a shift from the direct ship-to-ship affair, forcing you to multitask by commanding multiple squads of aircraft, as well as making sure you keep the carrier out of the reach of enemy ships. It takes time to become acclimated to using the aircraft carrier, but I found it to be a refreshing change from the familiar mechanics. It's challenging, but fun to master.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939167-0006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2939167\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939167-0006.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1406/14063904/2939167-0006.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Bomber planes may look small compared to ships, but they pack a wallop.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">But no matter which ship you choose, matches are composed of two competing fleets, both sides appropriately balanced among the four available classes, with aircraft carriers being the most seldom seen. In any given match you will see two at most, and sometimes none at all. Most of the enormous maps are dotted with islands large and small, providing plenty of ambush points where teams can form defensive walls and prepare for attacks. The zippy destroyers often reach these points first, covering the area in a thick smoke screen so they can safely launch torpedoes at any ship that wanders too close. Cruisers tend to play a supportive role, while imposing battleships line up in the back where they can send shells at foes over twelve kilometers away. Such a shooting distance is surpassed by higher-tier battleships, which can launch shells across more than twenty kilometers. At that point, your view of enemy ships reaches such heights that they look like toys floating in a bath tub.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Tension in battles builds slowly. The first minute or so are often wrought with silence and anticipation as you find your position, slowly scanning the horizon for any sign of the enemy fleet. Once things heat up, the fight is tense and fierce, and your very life depends on strategy, communication, and accuracy. You can’t escape death, however; eventually you’ll find yourself battered, with ruined guns and a damaged propeller. Dying on the battlefield allows you to enter spectator mode, but you can always return to port. Your ship will stay in the battle, which means having to pick another one if you plan on jumping back into the fight without delay. This, by the way, provides ample opportunity to experience other ships.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">And so you fight on, because nothing quite compares to making that perfect shot at a moving enemy ship, nor to the elation felt as the ship erupts in a thunderous boom. Even during the most strategically minded fights, spontaneity can still happen, resulting in your own fiery demise or a moment of triumph. In one of my most suspenseful experiences, I had just navigated around a small island only to come face-to-face with another cruiser; as we slid by, each going in opposite directions, I lined up my torpedo launchers and--like a battle from pirate lore--fired, turning my foe into a smoldering wreck.</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\" data-align=\"center\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The intensity of online battles is matched by the incredible variety of ships at your disposal.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Combat has strategic depth, especially once you factor in the extensive list of upgrades you can apply to your ship. There are commanders to train, signal flags to fly, module enhancements to research, small fighter planes you can launch from your ship, and more. The number of changes and tweaks you can perform can be daunting. Thankfully, you are introduced to these elements gradually as you earn new levels, giving you plenty of time to experiment as you open up the higher tiers. Spending credits and experience points earned by completing matches and missions allows you to unlock new ships. Progress, however, doesn’t come quickly.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Indeed, due to its free-to-play nature, advancement in World of Warships is sluggish. At times, it felt like I was playing battles just to grind for experience points and credits, which slightly dulled the enjoyment. Still, finally nabbing that ship that has been sitting in your crosshairs brings an incredible sense of accomplishment. Naturally, this spurs you on, looking to the next tier with newfound hunger.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939203-0002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2939203\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939203-0002.jpg\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1406/14063904/2939203-0002.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1406/14063904/2939203-0002.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bigger isn't always better when you're trying to avoid incoming fire.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The game includes premium content, if you’re willing to spend a little cash for some exclusive extras and boosters. It should be said that spending actual money on World of Warships isn’t a requirement to enjoy the game. However, if you feel that the pace is too slow for your liking, you can buy a premium account, adding a fifty-percent boost to credits and experience points earned for a set amount of days. Doubloons--in-game currency that can be bought--are used to purchase exclusive ship consumables with reduced cooldown timers, as well as port slots for more ships. Spending doubloons is also the only way to remove upgrades or redistribute skill points for your commander. A small handful of exclusive ships are also available for purchase, including two Soviet-made vessels.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">World of Warships’ matchmaking system worked well for much of the time I spent in-game, but there were some hiccups. Every third or fourth match I played mixed ships that were three tiers apart. Often, both sides will have matching tiers, from high to low, in order to keep things balanced; if there are a few tier-three vessels on one side, there’s a good chance the other team will have something similar. However, there is a world of difference between ships that are three tiers apart, and if they meet on the high seas, the lesser of the two typically stands a slim chance of survival. This can happen, especially when pitting divisions--groups of three--against each other, a process that seems to be determined by the highest ranking ship in a division, rather than an average of the group. This issue, however, is alleviated once you unlock ranked battles at level nine. Participation requires a tier six or seven ship, eliminating the concern over unbalanced teams.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">World of Warships runs smoothly and looks gorgeous. The game features islands and archipelagos covered in forests, jungle, or mossy stone; and sometimes dotted with houses and buildings. The ships themselves are highly detailed, from the wood paneling to the rusted hulls, down to individual rivets. Battles during sunsets are bathed in amber light and long shadows, almost making it too difficult not to be distracted by the scenery. Some weather effects include dark skies and lightning, but thankfully these small storms have no effect on the surrounding ocean, so you won’t have to fight both your enemies and nature at the same time.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939201-0009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2939201\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2939201-0009.jpg\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2939201-0009.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2939201-0009.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Time to buy some upgrades.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Though pretty, the game does come with a few annoying visual bugs, along with some glitches. Every so often, black boxes appear under the navigation markers on your strategic map. However, this is more annoying than game-breaking. Also, ship details sometimes have a tendency to pop in and out of existence. On occasion, binocular mode, which zooms your vision to your ship’s maximum range, gets stuck below the water-line, forcing you to slap at the keys a few times to dislodge it. This is not what you want to happen during an intense firefight.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">World of Warships does have a few small hitches, but they're easily manageable. Ultimately, the excitement that comes from commanding powerful ships during explosive battles on the high seas overshadows these faults. The thrills that await, along with the promise of unlocking advanced ships down the road, make World of Warships an enticing expedition into the sometimes turbulent waters of free-to-play games.</p><p style=\"\"> </p>",

They're going to leave a couple of gates unlocked. We're going in quiet. We shut down the cameras. We silence a stray guard here and there, but a lone mech-bot catches us because our inept soldier decides to go his own way instead of staying with the group. A camera catches the fiasco, and enemy guards close in on our position. But we find a little hiding hole, and five minutes later, it's like a gang of heavily armed thieves didn't just break into the largest gun-running operation in the Industrial District.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Satellite Reign lets you loose in a metropolis, where you're free to murder, sneak, and bribe your way to the top of the corporate ladder. Before it's all said and done, your squad might be equipped with poison-immune lungs, hive mind-hacking tech, cloaks, and cyber legs or laser shotguns with energy shields and high explosives. It's your team; it's your call. When Satellite Reign is at its tightest and most focused, it delivers the thrill and tension of leading a small squad into a rat's nest of traps and more enemies than you can ever kill on your own. Satellite Reign is also never more than one click away from ruining your mission with poor pathfinding or encounters with enemies with fleeting attention spans.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2938274-02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2938274\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2938274-02.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2938274-02.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Starting a firefight in the hotel courtyard was probably a mistake.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Satellite Reign's approach to plot is bare bones; it's more about dropping you into open areas and teasing new sandbox environments than telling an actual story. You control a squad of four mercenaries, each from a different classic cyberpunk archetype. You work your way through the game's city in pursuit of evil Dracogenics employees whose control over resurrection technology -- uploading your mind into someone else's body -- makes them the most powerful corp on the planet.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The beginning of Satellite Reign is brutal and not especially satisfying. There isn't much in the way of \"story\" missions. Beyond gaining the credentials to move from one district in the city to the other, your only required objective in Satellite Reign is to infiltrate Dracogenics Tower. So, you begin the game relatively directionless as you take on random tasks, get new gear, and level up the skills of your mercs. This is problematic because Satellite Reign is designed for you to take advantage of specific character builds and to vary the tech of your squad members, but it took me nearly six hours with the game before I felt like I had a squad that was equipped and properly leveled to manage the tasks given to me.</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\" data-align=\"center\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">When Satellite Reign is at its tightest and most focused, it delivers the thrill and tension of leading a small squad into a rat's nest of traps and more enemies than you can ever kill on your own.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Each enemy compound is a playground-like puzzle that tests your ability to manage your team's tools and abilities. My infiltrator (a stealth-specced sniper) became a core member of my team. I connected her mind with my hacker, and she was zipping in and out of compounds all by herself in the early stages thanks to her invisibility. I could have her in and out of early areas without setting off a single alarm, but later stages require more teamwork. You send your infiltrator in to turn off the initial security, and you bring in everybody else to clear out guards and disable traps. Poison gas floods your stealthy point of entry? The soldier can take care of that. Doors don’t open when you turn off the security system? Time for your support to scan the electronics network of the compound. Each area offers something for each member of your team to do no matter which builds you've chosen for your squad.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2938271-05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2938271\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2938271-05.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1406/14063904/2938271-05.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The future's so bright I have to wear shades</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">In its best moments, Satellite Reign keeps you on your toes -- particularly if you go with a stealth build. Enemies are everywhere, and although the game offers shadows for you to crawl to, the combination of cameras, enemy patrols, turrets, and massive tanks means the window of opportunity to escape unnoticed is thin if you aren't spamming your cloaking skill, which I wound up doing a lot. Sometimes, the only way to move through an area without drawing the attention of enemies is to create a major distraction elsewhere on the base. I had an infiltrator stuck in a compound, and I had to cause a ruckus at the base's entrance so she could sneak out the front door with the valuable prototypes she was carrying.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">This all assumes that Satellite Reign is working; however, it often doesn't. Satellite Reign's pathfinding is often poor, getting you into trouble when you least deserve it. Your teammates are either bunched together so tightly that their character models are indistinguishable or they've adopted a laissez-faire attitude while moving as a group, walking into plain sight on their own accord. To move from district to district, you have to pass through tight checkpoints, and stepping over certain lines causes every enemy in the city to come bearing down on you at once. At the first checkpoint, my team consistently stepped over those lines despite being told to go another way, and countless stealth missions were complicated when one of my teammates decided he just didn't want to go through the vent with everyone else.</p><blockquote data-size=\"large\" data-align=\"center\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Your teammates are either bunched together so tightly that their character models are indistinguishable or they've adopted a laissez-faire attitude while moving as a group, walking into plain sight on their own accord.</p></blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The pathfinding is bad, but its faults are overshadowed by the game's AI, which is simple and easily fooled. Although enemies are capable of some sophisticated sweep maneuvers when they've spotted you, it's far too easy to reset a failed stealth run by just sprinting to some dark corner of the base and hiding there til you get the all clear. In the beginning of the game, sending your soldiers into a base and shooting out every last camera before enemies open fire is a totally viable tactic. When your brazen infiltration is met with an enemy assault, don't worry, because after your sacrificial run into enemy territory ends in death, nobody bothers to fix or reset the security cameras, making your next run easier than it should be. It's far too easy to undermine Satellite Reign's threats by exploiting its simple AI systems.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2938278-03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2938278\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2938278-03.jpg\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1406/14063904/2938278-03.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1406/14063904/2938278-03.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>All those cameras &amp; drones would be more intimidating if I couldn't turn invisible.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Satellite Reign also refuses to engage with its cyberpunk milieu in a meaningful way, and when it does, it embraces the worst elements of the genre with little commentary or self-awareness. Though the neon-streaked city you explore is reminiscent of Blade Runner and your squad is equipped with enough ridiculous tech to make Hiro Protagonist blush, Satellite Reign is cyberpunk at a surface level. Conceptually, it has the chance to explore gaping wealth disparities, but the game does nothing with it. At it's worst, Satellite Reign relishes in cruelty. Though you're free to play many missions stealthily, others require you to kill people, some of whom are innocent citizens. In a particularly uncomfortable moment, you're ordered to murder the female neighbor of a corrupt executive to ensure that he cooperates, but there's never any evidence that she deserves to be dragged into the conflict and ultimately killed. It may be haphazard, but that sort of violence is borderline misogynistic and ultimately leaves a bad taste in my mouth.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">When Satellite Reign is on and all the parts decide they want to work together, it is a blast. Infiltrating a base without setting off any alarms and stealing new guns and money from under the enemy's nose is tense and satisfying, and you have to be willing to take risks to succeed. I just wish you didn't have to slog through the uninviting early hours and the game's regularly busted AI to find those thrills.</p><p style=\"\"> </p>",

            "description": "<p style=\"\">NHL 15 was, by all accounts, a disappointing game. It ended a long line of consistently great hockey games by removing many of the features that the series had become known for, such as offline shootouts and the EASHL, and crippling the ones that survived, such as Be A Pro and Be A GM. Thankfully, NHL 16 is a much better game. EA has brought back and revamped several modes, including the EA Sports Hockey League. The revival of these modes and the changes made have, for the most part, improved the experience enough to warrant a return to the ice; however, with the addition of the visual On-Ice Trainer, it’s easier than ever for newcomers to jump in and play, too.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The gameplay feels great, online and off. Every facet of NHL 16 is more fluid than those in previous years, and it feels like you have more control over each position. I felt it was easier to move the puck across the ice while skating and passing, and playing defense is an experience that feels a lot better, too -- when I hit someone, it feels powerful. This is also evident when you play goalie; the controls for goaltending have been redone, making it easier to move precisely and catch those tricky one-timers. Because of this, I’ve grown to actually enjoy goaltending, so when no one else will guard the net in a game, I’m more than happy to take the job.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2937963-01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2937963\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.56253065228053\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2937963-01.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2937963-01.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Goaltending is fun now? Yes!</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The On-Ice Trainer is a visual aid that augments the ice and skaters with hints, teaching you how to play the game while you play. It starts off with the basics, such as face-offs and shooting, then it moves on to more advanced skills as you prove you’ve become proficient. It’ll tell you how to take a wristshot, and once you’ve done it enough, it’ll move you on to slapshots. This was very useful for me when it came to face-offs because I’ve always had a hard time understanding exactly how they worked -- at times, I’d think I had a handle on them, but I would be proved wrong soon after. With the On-Ice Trainer, there’s no confusion: it tells me exactly how to win and why I failed or succeeded. These hints disappear organically or you can turn them off entirely. It’s an incredible tool that helped me become a stronger player, and although I was worried about becoming dependent on the trainer, I was tackling and winning face-offs without even realizing that the tips had vanished.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The On-Ice Trainer was especially useful in Be A Pro mode, which allows you to create a skater and proceed from the minors to the end of a long, hopefully prosperous NHL career. You can go through the minors as a CHL rookie or skip that and join a team that’s already competing for the Memorial Cup. Your job is to play a role on a team based on the position you choose. The trainer can help here, but even if you don’t use it, you’ll still get detailed instructions from your coach telling you how to improve your game in three different areas: offense, defense, and team play.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2937975-03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2937975\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2937975-03.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2937975-03.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Alright, Fleischmann, we'll raise your allowance, but just this once!</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">All you have to do to become a stronger player is play; taking shots and poke checking will give you experience in their respective categories, in this case offense and defense. One problem I had with Be a Pro occurred when my player led the league in goals and points but was bumped off the starting formation, which gave him less ice time. My player was demoted because he was lacking defensive and team play skills, but scoring two or more goals a game and being punished seemed a little weird, especially since I was posting numbers higher than anyone else in the league. Despite this issue, it’s enjoyable and immensely satisfying when you make a lot of progress.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Be A GM is an entertaining mode, one in which I lost hours in the menus alone. Whether I’m trying to make that clutch trade or having my heart broken because I couldn’t seal a deal with a favourite player, I’m engaged in the fantasy team I’m creating. Making the choices you wish your favourite team’s manager would make feels empowering; putting together the next Stanley Cup champions takes a lot of work, but it’s satisfying when it pays off.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The offline shootout joins its online counterpart again this year, something that I’m personally glad to see happen. Playing shootouts against a friend provided some of the most fun I’ve had playing the NHL series, often resulting in a lot of trash talking and laughter. Moments when you hope you can fake out your friend to get the puck past them are exhilarating; quickly starting a rematch keeps the competition high, preventing the intensity from being killed by a load time. It doesn’t translate to online multiplayer because you aren’t shoulder-to-shoulder with a friend, which makes its return after its absence in NHL 15 greatly appreciated.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Online versus and team play are both engaging when you want to play against someone other than an A.I. opponent, but Hockey Ultimate Team is where I spent most of my time online. Ultimate Team has you open a pack of cards at the start, which will be used as your first line-up for the team you create. Once your team is ready, you can take it online or play against the A.I. You can always grind for more in-game currency to spend on packs, but if you want to get cards faster, you can also buy packs with real money.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2937978-04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2937978\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2937978-04.jpg\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2937978-04.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1406/14063904/2937978-04.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Building the team of your dreams can be fun, but it comes at a cost.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">After buying a couple of packs with real money and in-game currency and creating the best line-up I could muster, I became invested in my team. Winning games also felt like more of an accomplishment because I had to work with what I was given. Losing games, on the other hand, made me feel like I needed to buy another pack in the hopes of getting a better goalie. However, you never know what you’re getting, and not every pack had cards that I could use to improve my given lineup. Considering that each Gold Jumbo pack costs 4 or 5 dollars, spending in-game currency, let alone real money, to end up with a pack of disappointing cards is a momentary turn-off. I’ve put a lot of time into this mode, and I will continue to do so as time goes on, but because there’s no guarantee that I’ll get a card that suits my needs, there’s little chance that I’ll spend any more real money on cards.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2937989-05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2937989\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.56235107227959\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1406/14063904/2937989-05.jpg\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1406/14063904/2937989-05.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1406/14063904/2937989-05.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Playing in the EASHL can be a lot of fun, provided that you're playing with a team of dedicated players.</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The EASHL also returns after being removed from last year’s game, and the changes EA made provide a more balanced experience. You create and customize your own pro player, and at the beginning of each game, you choose a position and class, such as power forward, sniper, and butterfly goalie. Each class plays differently, and by focusing on one position for an entire game, you ultimately learn how to become a better player overall. When I played as power forward, I threw a lot of hard hits and cleared the ice because of it. When I played as a sniper, I was faster and scored more goals. Your player’s progress in EASHL is measured by badges, which you earn by completing class-specific feats, such as scoring goals or making saves. These contribute to your player’s overall level, and it feels good to be rewarded for closing out a game with a shutout or scoring a hat trick.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">EASHL allows you to play games as a member of a club or by dropping into a match with a group of strangers. Dropping into random games is hit-or-miss; it’s not uncommon for teammates to drop out of a game if your team is losing. This makes the experience incredibly frustrating, and it happens far too often. I had more fun playing with a club, with people sticking together as a team and not leaving games at the drop of a hat. While playing online, I’ve encountered at least one instance of stuttering per game. I’ve experienced games that have been near unplayable, but those have been very far and few between.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">NHL 16’s menus can be confusing, and the plethora of information within team rosters isn’t always easy to decipher at a quick glance. The in-game presentation, however, is superb. Every stadium feels genuine. The Blue Jackets’ Nationwide Arena fires a cannon every time they score, the Tampa Bay Lightning have their Tesla coils going at Amelie Arena, and the Vancouver Canucks’ Green Men show up at Rogers Arena from time to time to heckle the opposing team’s players. It feels weird to geek out about a hockey video game, but these little touches are exciting to see, making the arena’s atmosphere feel more alive in the process.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">NHL 16 is exciting not only for dedicated fans due to the return of the long-lost modes of years past but also for new players or even people who just want to get better. The On-Ice Trainer is an awesome alternative to tutorials, and it makes me hope that other companies, not just those making sports games, will find a way to implement similar tools. NHL 16 is a huge improvement over NHL 15 in every way, and it makes me optimistic for the future of the franchise.</p><p style=\"\"> </p>",

            "description": "<p style=\"\">There is a quiet, almost imperceptible genius to <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/pro-evolution-soccer-2016/\">PES 2016</a> that will leave players struggling to explain exactly why they have fallen in love with it.</p><p style=\"\">This finely crafted soccer sim will be lauded by fans who, almost certainly, will base their judgements around the word \"feel\". As in, doing almost everything in PES 2016 <i>feels </i>fantastic, from fearless and desperate sliding tackles, to holding up the ball under pressure, to the heavenly wave of pride that comes with outthinking and turning a defender.</p><p style=\"\">Such ethereal joys make PES 2016 wonderful in ways that its peers and predecessors are not. How developer PES Productions has delivered on this, however, is tricky to discern. Great design is transparent, goes the saying, and 2016's triumph does not come from a standout feature that can be snappily summarised on the back of the box. It's not your old smartphone but now with a fingerprint scanner. It's not Malibu Stacy with a new hat.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-6426469\" data-src=\"/videos/how-can-pes-2016-compete-with-fifa-16/2300-6426469/\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe src=\"/videos/embed/6426469/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p style=\"\">PES 2016 sings in your hands for more elaborate reasons, namely how it wonderfully converges two rather sexless elements: Physics and AI. The advances made in these fundamentals have achieved a more physical, smarter, strategic soccer sim for both football nerds and casual fans alike. It's more fluid, fluctuant, and alive than ever.</p><p style=\"\">Above all else, the most meaningful stride forward is the new collision system, which so much now hinges on. Considering that soccer games live and die by their authenticity, and that dynamic physics systems almost inevitably throw up <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/dlpbf.gif\">gif-worthy calamities</a>, you have to commend the audacity of PES Productions for betting the whole farm on its new tech. What's quite remarkable is how faultless it has turned out to be, free from comical miscalculations and distorted momentum swings.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2936906-pes-2016-master-league-main-menu-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2936906\" data-ratio=\"0.56298600311042\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2936906-pes-2016-master-league-main-menu-1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1544/15443861/2936906-pes-2016-master-league-main-menu-1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Master League redesign adds in a calendar and news headlines, and the overall presentation will seem familiar to Football Manager fans.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Flaccid terms like \"collision system\" may not ignite the hype, but the tech is a godsend. It brings new life to challenges for possession; no longer are they binary exchanges where either a tackle works or doesn't. Here, fights for the ball are more organic, unpredictable, combative affairs. PES 2016 doesn't rely on canned animations of players giving up and falling over; instead players barge back, protect the ball, and scramble for balance when their shins are clipped. You have more control over your fate, and no longer do you feel anxious to pass the ball away when under pressure. Players can protect themselves, wait for options to unfold, and if fleet-footed enough, can dance out of trouble.</p><p style=\"\">Those challenging for possession will prod and push, but reaching the ball does not equal automatic success. The player collision meshes are water-tight, which, combined with the brainpower of the physics system, means that erratic sliding tackles can result in tangled legs and the ball bobbling away. Meanwhile, the tech also gives smaller players the chance to disrupt towering centre-forwards as they jostle to connect with an oncoming cross. Ultimately it means that timing and canniness has become just as important as ferocity and speed, giving PES 2016 an excellent feel (that word again) of realism and fluidity. PES 2015's aggravating pass delay issue, meanwhile, has been fully resolved.</p><p style=\"\">The outcome of such improvements might be considered a key moment for Konami's dethroned soccer series. PES 2016 proclaims that no longer do you have to play games of tactless scuffles for possession in search of that Hollywood goal. No longer should you settle for a robotic and clunky back-and-forth for control whilst you pray for that scintillating breakthrough. This is a game that converts the minute-by-minute battles for possession into micro-sized wars of glory and anguish. PES 2016 wants you to have fun between the highlights. This is a game that revels in its own scrappiness, with passes pinging wayward from the outstretched leg of a indomitable defender, with shots deflecting off shins and knees and into the opposite path of where the keeper was diving.</p><p style=\"\">It's not perfect. In the transition to the new physics system, it appears that PES is not quite sure what a foul is. Any tackle is deemed fair game providing the ball is touched, and while that is an understandable baseline rule, in practice even the most perverse and dangerous sliding tackles are unpunished. One suspects the officials would allow E. Honda's Hundred-Hand Slap as long as he flicked the ball in the process. Meanwhile, assaulting a random player, accidentally or not, sometimes isn't even deemed a foul. There is a reasonable argument to be had in Konami's defence, in that the flow of a game shouldn't be disrupted by silly and inconsequential fingerslips, but nevertheless it breaks the illusion.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2936908-http---pthumbnails.5min.com-10380083-519004138_3_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2936908\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2936908-http---pthumbnails.5min.com-10380083-519004138_3_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1544/15443861/2936908-http---pthumbnails.5min.com-10380083-519004138_3_o.jpg\"></a><figcaption>As ever, PES 2016 misses out on official licenses. Yet its community will rejoice at the editor on PS4 and Xbox One (you can upload images too).</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">But this is the only negative trade-off that comes with switching to a dynamic collision system. The positives are bountiful. Another is the marvellous job PES Productions has done crafting the individual physical traits of key players, many of which are now imbued with new layers of realism in how they move and interact. Tevez can bullishly dash into the box whilst hustling defenders in pursuit, Lewandowski can steamroll centrebacks, and Robben can perform his signature jink down the right, cutting inside, and placing the ball in the far post.</p><p style=\"\">How these are animated is exceptional. You'd still know you were watching Robben even if he was wearing a wig. How he runs, twists, and curls his left leg when shooting is all faithfully recreated. Konami claims that PES 2016 amasses three times the volume of animations than its predecessor; a bold statement that invites cynicism, but a believable one nevertheless.</p><p style=\"\">It's a shame, then, that the graphical fidelity does not quite match the standards set by the animations. Much of PES 2016 was built with the Fox Engine, and aside from how intriguing it is to see how Balotelli would look in <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-review-roundup/1100-6429983/\">Metal Gear Solid 5</a>, sometimes the character models resemble animated cadavers when cast in unflattering light. They also can't smile properly, which results in unintentionally hilarious contract signing cut-scenes.</p><p style=\"\">That's probably a little harsh on a game that has clearly improved its visuals from last year. The lighting is less washed out, the pitch and clothing textures are sharper, and the weather effects are fine. These improvements don't extend to the UI and menu system, however, which still carries a couple of nagging foibles, such as untidy text alignment on the formation and tactics pages.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2936910-ob_385b2e_pes-2016-image-screenshot-6-0903d40000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2936910\" data-ratio=\"0.5030612244898\" data-width=\"980\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 980px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1544/15443861/2936910-ob_385b2e_pes-2016-image-screenshot-6-0903d40000.jpg\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1544/15443861/2936910-ob_385b2e_pes-2016-image-screenshot-6-0903d40000.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1544/15443861/2936910-ob_385b2e_pes-2016-image-screenshot-6-0903d40000.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Teams under pressure will park the bus, which in turn can trap them in their own half. Only cool heads will prevail.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Such trivialities wash away at kick-off, when the <i>feel </i>engulfs you. Matches are brought to life thanks to the AI, which sets a new benchmark for the genre. It's almost as if you and the computer have known each other for years; AI teammates move off the ball realistically, and signal where they want the pass, and run into the exact pocket of space that you hoped they would.</p><p style=\"\">In each game you encounter dozens of these smart individual AI decisions, but just as impressive is how players work together as a unit. A deeper understanding of the sport runs throughout each team, which works hard to retain formation whilst adapting to opportunities and dangers. Fullbacks overlap, midfielders drop back, defenders close gaps, keepers dash out of the box, but in all cases, only when it makes sense. It inspires more calculated build-up play, where it's the better team that emerges victorious, as opposed to the one that had the most superstar moments.</p><p style=\"\">Like with all recent editions of PES, a wealth of gameplay options await, with updates to modes such as Become A Legend, Master League, and MyClub (the latter was inaccessible during review due to the servers being down). Master League has been given a brilliant <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/football-manager-2015-review/1900-6415936/\">Football Manager</a>-aping redesign, with a calendar view and news items all displayed on its home screen.</p><p style=\"\">Yet there's little worth in assessing soccer sims by the weight of their game modes, or indeed, the breadth of their official licences. All that truly matters is what unfolds in those virtual ninety minutes, either against a friend, an online stranger, or the computer. On that test alone, PES 2016 represents the best game in the series since the PlayStation 2 era.</p>",

Before the crowdfunding comes to a close, it's met yet another stretch goal, and developer Larian Studios has also announced that a veteran RPG developer will be working on the game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">In an update on the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/larianstudios/divinity-original-sin-2/posts/1363117\">Kickstarter page</a> today, Larian revealed that Chris Avellone \"has agreed [to] develop and write at least one of the playable origin stories in the game.\" Avellone has an extensive history in the RPG space, having worked on <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/fallout-2/\">Fallout 2 </a>and <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/planescape-torment/\">Planescape: Torment </a>before founding Obsidian Entertainment, where he contributed to games likes <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/\">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/fallout-new-vegas/\">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.

Prior to the Kickstarter kicking off, Larian asked fans <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-2-announced-prototype-playab/1100-6429670/\">what kind of backer rewards</a> they wanted to see, and the idea of Avellone being brought on proved to be extremely popular. While not something that could be offered as a reward, this led to Avellone and Larian founder Swen Vincke meeting at PAX in August.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\"This is the first time I think the community is responsible for bringing two developers together who might not have crossed paths... and especially for such a great project,\" Avellone said about today's news. \"I have a lot of respect for Larian Studios, Swen, and Divinity: Original Sin; it's one of the best game Kickstarters ever. I met Swen at PAX Prime, talked about RPGs for hours, and at the end of it, it was clear we were on the same page. Now? We're primed to do something great, and I'm proud to be part of it.\"</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7UYk-pHmww\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FK7UYk-pHmww%3Fwmode%3Dopaque%26feature%3Doembed&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DK7UYk-pHmww&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FK7UYk-pHmww%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=6efca6e5ad9640f180f14146a0bc1392&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">There are now just over four days left before the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/larianstudios/divinity-original-sin-2\">Kickstarter </a>comes to an end on September 30.

This is due in part to the difficulty in \"deliver[ing] a great experience reliably on Windows.\" Adding Xbox One (or any other platform, including OS X or Linux) would complicate things before the Rift has had a chance to become established on Windows <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/pc/\">PC</a>s.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/123/1239113/2942653-oculus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2942653\" data-ratio=\"0.55633802816901\" data-width=\"852\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 852px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/123/1239113/2942653-oculus.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/123/1239113/2942653-oculus.jpg\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\"No one is really thinking right now about bringing the Rift to a console, especially when the spec is so different from what we're targeting right now,\" Mitchell said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">The idea of an Xbox One Rift headset isn't so crazy, as Microsoft and Oculus have been working together. Oculus announced earlier this year that <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/oculus-rift-includes-xbox-one-controller-xbox-one-/1100-6428007/\">every Rift will ship with an Xbox One controller</a>. (There will also be a separate, Rift-specific controller <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/oculus-reveals-its-unusual-rift-vr-controller-ocul/1100-6428010/\">called the Oculus Touch</a>.) Additionally, Rift owners will be able to <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/oculus-rift-includes-xbox-one-controller-xbox-one-/1100-6428007/\">stream Xbox One games through a PC to a Rift headset</a>, but only so that they can be viewed in a sort of virtual theater--you won't be playing the games themselves in actual VR.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Mitchell went on to explain that it isn't a matter of the Xbox One not having enough horsepower to support VR--<a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/99-gear-vr-edition-revealed-netflix-and-twitch-app/1100-6430879/\">Gear VR runs off a Samsung phone</a>--it's just a different set of challenges.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\"That's the thing, you can absolutely deliver a great VR experience on Xbox One; what I should say is with the hardware that's in the Xbox One,\" Mitchell said in response to a question about the Xbox One being powerful enough. \"We're not really focused on it right now. It really depends on the content you want to put there.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">Microsoft has yet to publicly show a great deal of interest in virtual reality, and has instead <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-halo-and-hololens-merged-at-e3-2015-magic-hap/1100-6428288/\">focused on augmented reality through projects like HoloLens</a>. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer has said he <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-virtual-reality-is-not-a-fad/1100-6418747/\">doesn't think VR is a fad</a>, but he recently told GameSpot that he personally <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-interview-phil-spencer-on-halo-the-future-of-/1100-6430815/\">hopes VR doesn't become the only way to play games</a>.</p><p style=\"\">Sony, meanwhile, is taking a much different approach with PlayStation VR (<a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vr-is-sonys-official-name-for-project-/1100-6430567/\">née Porject Morpheus</a>), though it still has yet to offer <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-vr-headset-to-be-priced-as-a-new-gaming-platfo/1100-6430703/\">specific pricing and release details for the PS4 device</a>.</p>",

Co-director Neil Druckmann says in a new interview the decision to push the <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/ps4/\">PlayStation 4</a> game out a few months was not an easy one, but was required to make sure the team nailed the ending.</p><p style=\"\">\"It was a very hard decision,\" Druckmann said in the latest issue of <a href=\"http://www.gamesradar.com/opm-subs/\"><em>OPM </em></a>(via <a href=\"http://www.gamesradar.com/uncharted-4-delayed-because-ending/\">GamesRadar</a>). Uncharted 4 is the<a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/uncharted-4-is-nathan-drake-s-final-chapter-develo/1100-6428305/\"> final game in the series to star Nathan Drake</a>, and Druckmann teases that the studio has something special in mind for the very last scene. Getting this right took more time than previously anticipated.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-6427029\" data-src=\"/videos/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-tokyo-game-show-2015-trai/2300-6427029/\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe src=\"/videos/embed/6427029/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p style=\"\">\"Even when I'm describing the ending, it's a pretty... Well, I guess this is a little bit of a spoil... Nah, I'm not going to say it! But there is something that happens that requires quite a bit of work for what we want it to do,\" Druckmann said. \"And again, we would have had to reduce that scope and reduce that ambition to meet that [original] deadline.\"</p><p style=\"\">Druckmann said he knew the decision to move the game back would frustrate some fans, but it was ultimately decided that a delay was in the best interest of the overall experience.</p><p style=\"\">\"It was going to disappoint [fans] to push this thing back,\" he said. \"But this is the last chapter for Nathan Drake, so let's give ourselves as much time as possible and go all-out for this series.\"</p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/uncharted-4-release-date-special-collectors-editio/1100-6430192/\">Uncharted 4 launches on March 18</a> exclusively for PS4. You won't have to wait that long to play an Uncharted game on PS4, however, as <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection/\">The Nathan Drake Collection</a> debuts in early October.

Unlike rivals Marvel, who are seven years and many movies into their Cinematic Universe, DC's sole offering to date is 2013's <em>Man of Steel</em>.</p><p style=\"\">Now screenwriter Jason Fuchs has spoken about what will set DC's superhero films apart from those of Marvel. Fuchs is strongly rumoured to be the screenwriter of the forthcoming <em>Woman Woman</em>. While he has not officially confirmed this, in an interview with <a href=\"http://collider.com/wonder-woman-screenwriter-jason-fuchs-dc-cinematic-universe/\">Collider</a> to promote his new film <em>Pan</em>, he did speak about working for DC.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576725/2942536-gal.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2942536\" style=\"width: 800px\" data-ratio=\"0.5525\" data-width=\"800\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576725/2942536-gal.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1557/15576725/2942536-gal.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">\"When you work for DC, it's sort of like working for the CIA,\" he said. \"You have a vow of silence. I think, as we speak, [<em>Man of Steel</em> director] Zack Snyder's gonna come in here and put a muzzle on me. The trouble with these things is that you really can't say much. So I'm excited about everything that's going on in that universe.</p><p style=\"\">\"I've certainly read the same reports you've read about my involvement and what that might be, but I can only speak to it as a fan. I don't think it's any secret that people who have seen the <em>Batman v Superman</em> trailer, the <em>Suicide Squad</em> trailer, can see that this is a very different cinematic universe than the one that Marvel has constructed over at Disney.</p><p style=\"\">\"It's a really specific, grand, slightly darker, slightly grittier place. As a fan of those comic books, a fan of those movies, I'm excited to see where it goes next.\"</p><p style=\"\"><em>Wonder Woman</em> is scheduled for a June 23, 2017 release, directed by Patty Jenkins and starring Gal Gadot.

            "description": "<p style=\"\">Ahead of Oculus Rift's consumer launch in 2016, Oculus VR has announced an \"<a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/ja/oculus-ready-pcs/\">Oculus Ready</a>\" program for <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/pc/\">PC</a>s. Essentially, this is a line of Oculus-branded PCs from big-name companies like Dell, Alienware, and Asus that are specifically designed to work right out of the box with the Oculus Rift VR headset.</p><p style=\"\">These systems, described by Oculus as \"high-performances PC optimized for the Rift,\" cover the <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/oculus-rift-s-recommended-pc-specs-resolution-anno/1100-6427370/\">headset's recommended system requirements</a>. The cheapest model announced so far is from Asus, and starts at $949. The other systems, from Dell and Alienware, are offered at starting prices of $999.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1179/11799911/2942538-oculus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2942538\" data-ratio=\"0.30786686838124\" data-width=\"1280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1179/11799911/2942538-oculus.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1179/11799911/2942538-oculus.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">As mentioned, these systems will come with special Oculus Ready branding (see below), and will ship when <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/oculus-rift-consumer-model-to-launch-early-2016/1100-6427123/\">Rift's consumer model debuts in Q1 2016</a>.</p><p style=\"\">The full system specifications for these Oculus Ready PCs have not been announced. As announced previously, Oculus Rift's recommended PC specifications are as follows:</p><ul><li>NVIDIA GTX 970 / AMD 290 equivalent or greater</li><li>Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater</li><li>8GB+ RAM</li><li>Compatible HDMI 1.3 video output (required)</li><li>2x USB 3.0 ports (required)</li><li>Windows 7 SP1 or newer (required)</li></ul><p style=\"\">Oculus has not yet confirmed a price for the Rift headset, but the company has said you should <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/oculus-vr-with-a-new-computer-should-cost-around-1/1100-6427633/\">expect to pay $1,500 for an \"all-in\" setup</a> that includes a capable PC and the device itself. If $949-$999 is the baseline for Rift-compatible PCs, that would put the price of the headset itself (which<a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/oculus-rift-includes-xbox-one-controller-xbox-one-/1100-6428007/\"> comes with an Xbox One controller</a>) at around $500, though of course this is not confirmed.</p><p style=\"\">By comparison, the <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/ps4/\">PlayStation 4</a> VR headset,<a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-vr-is-sonys-official-name-for-project-/1100-6430567/\"> formerly known as Project Morpheus</a>, is expected to cost <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-vr-headset-to-be-priced-as-a-new-gaming-platfo/1100-6430703/\">about as much as new gaming platform</a>. The major difference between PlayStation VR and Rift, however, is that PlayStation VR will play directly off the PS4 you may already own without the need for extra hardware. PlayStation 4 VR launches in the <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-morpheus-vr-headset-launching-in-2016/1100-6425672/\">first half of 2016</a>, meaning it will be out before July.</p><p style=\"\">The Oculus Ready program was announced this week during the Oculus Connect conference.

But this story has since been expanded to become a \"saga.\"</p><p style=\"\">\"While we originally said trilogy, we've actually expanded this to more of a saga, so we don't want to limit the Reclaimer story within a trilogy,\" Microsoft <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-new-halo-for-xbox-one-is-legitimate/1100-6410554/\">confirmed back in 2013</a>.</p><p style=\"\">O'Connor went on to say that, looking beyond Halo 6, Microsoft knows, at a high level at least, what's going to happen in the Halo universe a decade from now. Recently, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said Halo has <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-can-last-as-long-as-star-wars-and-spider-man-/1100-6430819/\">staying power similar to other juggernaut franchises such as <em>Star Wars </em>and <em>Spider-Man</em></a>. Spencer said he thinks Halo will <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-can-last-as-long-as-star-wars-and-spider-man-/1100-6430819/\">still be popular 20 years from now in 2035</a>, something that 343 studio head Bonnie Ross agreed with as part of the GamesRadar interview.</p><p style=\"\">She said that the work done on the Halo franchise by Bungie with<a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halo-3-odst-review/1900-6228780/\"> Halo 3: ODST</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halo-reach-review/1900-6275772/\">Halo: Reach</a> laid \"the fictional foundation for the next 20 years\" of Halo.</p><p style=\"\">\"You can look at the ending of Halo 4--and where Master Chief is, and obviously we had to know where we were going to take Halo 5 and Halo 6 with that,\" she said. \"You have an epic sci-fi universe and we have multiple ways that we can go with this story, but all the pieces are laying there. The canvas is there for us to paint.\"</p><p style=\"\">O'Connor wasn't ready to commit to any specifics about Halo 6 or other future games, saying, \"If you start making those stepping stones too rigid, then you're not being realistic about the game development process.\"</p><p style=\"\">But O'Connor, who has worked on the Halo franchise for more than a decade, first at Bungie and now with Microsoft, said the story planning team already has a good idea where Master Chief's story will end.</p><p style=\"\">\"We know what’s going to happen in the next game, and we kind of know what's going to happen to the Master Chief ultimately,\" he explained.</p><p style=\"\">That Microsoft would be planning more Halo games should come as no surprise. After all, with <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-series-reaches-65-million-units-sold/1100-6428844/\">more than 65 million copies sold</a>, Halo is Microsoft's crown jewel. \"It's our biggest exclusive franchise,\" Spencer <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-interview-phil-spencer-on-halo-the-future-of-/1100-6430815/\">recently said</a>. \"There's no doubt about that.\"</p><p style=\"\">The<a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-5-trailers-confirm-october-release-date/1100-6426251/\"> Halo 5 release date </a>is set for October 27 on Xbox One.

that the Battlefront beta will let you advance your character up to level five. Once players hit the cap, they can't progress to higher levels, but can still unlock additional items. EA has not announced the level cap for the full Battlefront game.</p><p style=\"\">The Battlefront beta<a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-beta-dates-revealed/1100-6430875/\"> will run October 8-12</a>. You do not need to preorder the game to play, as the pre-release play period is open to everyone. EA also stresses that the beta is being held in part to allow DICE to test aspects of the game's online infrastructure. As such, players may run into \"interruptions\" during gameplay. What's more, progress earned during the beta will not carry forward to the full game.</p><p style=\"\">In addition, EA shared some new descriptions for the three modes that will be playable in the Battlefront beta.</p><h3><strong>Battlefront Beta Modes:</strong></h3><p style=\"\"><em><strong>Descriptions courtesy of EA</strong></em></p><ul><li><strong>Walker Assault on Hoth:</strong> Fight in epic 40-player battles as a Rebel to destroy the Empire’s onslaught of AT-ATs by calling in Y-wing bombers. Or, side with the Empire and protect your walkers while utilizing their mighty weaponry to crush the Rebel objective.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Drop Zone on Sullust:</strong> Escape pods are crashing down and you and your team must fight to control them. With its frantic 8v8 matches, Drop Zone is sure to put your combat and strategy skills to the test.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Survival Mission on Tatooine:</strong> Play alone or with a friend via co-op or split-screen as you battle to hold off waves of Imperial forces including AT-ST’s, TIE fighters, elite Stormtroopers, and more.</li></ul><p style=\"\">Players can also check out the new Battlefront \"Companion\" experience <a href=\"http://starwars.ea.com/starwars/battlefront\">at the game's website</a> during the beta period. One part of this is a strategic card game called Base Command that lets players earn in-game credits that they can then use to unlock weapons and Star Cards in the full Battlefront game.</p><p style=\"\">Battlefront launches on November 17, about a month before Disney's <em>Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens </em>hits theaters in December. EA is also releasing <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-new-concept-art-for-star-wars-battlefront-batt/1100-6430105/\">tie-in DLC for Battlefront based on the movie</a>.</p><p style=\"\">Xbox One owners with an EA Access membership will get to play Battlefront first, as it will be available through the subscription program <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-to-release-five-days-early-o/1100-6430855/\">a full five days early</a>.</p>",

The third standalone <em>Wolverine</em> film is currently scheduled for a 2017 release, but in an interview with <a href=\"http://collider.com/wolverine-3-hugh-jackman-on-patrick-stewart-professor-x-father-son-relationship/\">Collider</a>, Jackman revealed that the film was still being written.</p><p style=\"\">\"I'll be really honest with you, the actual script in its full form we're up to about page 60. Obviously there's a treatment, so it's not fully done yet, we're not fully there,\" he said. \"I'm sounding a little cagey because this is the last time I'm playing him, and I have just made the commitment to myself, really, and told everyone that until that script is perfect, until it is that perfect way to sign out, I'm not gonna start shooting.\"</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576725/2942496-wolverine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2942496\" style=\"width: 800px\" data-ratio=\"0.60875\" data-width=\"800\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/original/1557/15576725/2942496-wolverine.jpg\"><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1557/15576725/2942496-wolverine.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Jackman also stated that Patrick Stewart's Professor X character would play a part in the new movie, something Stewart himself <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/x-men-star-patrick-stewart-to-appear-in-next-wolve/1100-6429766/\">confirmed</a> in August.</p><p style=\"\">\"Patrick does figure in it, that's for sure,\" Jackman said. \"I think it's a really important relationship but I want to see signs of that quasi-father/son sort of relationship that has not been seen before, and sides of particularly Professor X that have not been seen before. So we have some really, really cool ideas.</p><p style=\"\">\"I really have known for quite a long time how I want to finish this sort of odyssey that I've been on, this amazing journey. And I won't let it fall anywhere in between. I won't fall short of it.\"</p><p style=\"\">According to Jackman, the plan is to start shooting next year, although the production location was currently \"one of the things that is up in the air.\"</p><p style=\"\">The third <em>Wolverine</em> will be directed by James Mangold, who previously helmed 2013's <em>The Wolverine</em>, which went on to make more than $400 million worldwide. At San Diego Comic-Con in July, Jackman <a href=\"http://comicbook.com/2015/07/12/hugh-jackman-hints-at-old-man-logan-for-wolverine-3/\">hinted strongly </a>that the film would draw from the Old Man Logan line of comic books, a futuristic storyline which sees Wolverine as the world's last remaining mutant.</p><p style=\"\">The film is one of four upcoming films that form part of Fox's X-Men universe, with <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-deadpools-first-full-length-trailer/1100-6429475/\"><em>Deadpool</em></a> due in February 2016, <em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em> following in July, and the <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-superhero-movie-gambit-loses-director/1100-6430676/\">currently directorless</a> <em>Gambit</em> scheduled for next October.</p>",

It's a win-win.”</p><p style=\"\">Also in FanDuel's announcement, the company said it expects the number of esports fans to \"come close\" to that of American football by the year 2017.

The theme to the forthcoming <em>Spectre</em>, called \"The Writing's On The Wall\" and performed by British singer Sam Smith, can be heard below:</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"http://open.spotify.com/album/0iOC24pLNQ6BsEU74GuhNe\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\"><iframe src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fembed.spotify.com%2F%3Furi%3Dspotify%3Aalbum%3A0iOC24pLNQ6BsEU74GuhNe&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Falbum%2F0iOC24pLNQ6BsEU74GuhNe&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fo.scdn.co%2Fcover%2Fb80ade2e5512cc3df79b958d522d0cf689552309&amp;key=6efca6e5ad9640f180f14146a0bc1392&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=spotify\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p style=\"\">Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAAahUKEwj70JmU7JHIAhVB1RoKHUxDAk0&amp;url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-spectre-theme-to-be-sung-by-sam-smith/1100-6430372/&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8OuvA7-VLRFzQheDqE3_ytK9OzQ&amp;bvm=bv.103627116,d.d24\">Smith explained</a> that the track, written with regular musical partner Jimmy Napes, had been recorded way back in January. \"I got called into the office with Barbara Broccoli and Sam Mendes and they gave me the script,\" he said. \"I read the script. They said, 'Have a go at the song.' It's the quickest I've ever written a song--it took 20 minutes and they loved it!\"</p><p style=\"\">The 23-year-old is the first British male solo artist to record a Bond song since Tom Jones sang the theme to <em>Thunderball</em> way back in 1965. To date, Smith has sold more than eight million albums worldwide.</p><p style=\"\"><em>Spectre</em> arrives in cinemas on November 6, 2015.</p><p style=\"\">For more Bond news, check out the following:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-bond-spectre-video-shows-off-action/1100-6430857/\">New Bond Spectre Video Shows Off Action</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-james-bond-star-pierce-brosnan-discusses-th/1100-6430838/\">Former James Bond Star Pierce Brosnan Discusses the Next 007</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-films-female-stars-showcased-in-fea/1100-6429769/\">New James Bond Film's Female Stars Showcased in Featurette</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-the-new-007-spectre-trailer/1100-6429084/\">Watch the New 007 Spectre Trailer</a></li></ul><p style=\"\"> </p>",

To better prepare you for what&#039;s in store, here&#039;s a full rundown on what you need to know about all the exciting new characters at your disposal!&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Blitz</h2><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2940679-classmenus.00_00_08_23.still001.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team: &lt;/strong&gt;Attackers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affiliation: &lt;/strong&gt;GSG 9 (Border Protection Group 9 of the Federal Police)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; As an expert at front-lines combat with an imposing physique to boot, Blitz is an operator well-suited for anyone looking to get into their opponents&#039; faces. His special item is a flash shield, which is literally a shield equipped with the blinding capabilities of a flash bang. If you&#039;re looking for a solid operator class to play as, Blitz is a worthy addition to any team regardless of the mode of play.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>IQ</h2><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2940680-classmenus.00_00_12_02.still002.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Attackers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affiliation: &lt;/strong&gt;GSG 9 (Border Protection Group 9 of the Federal Police)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; IQ is an electrical engineer who comes equipped with a detector capable of sensing anything emitting electronic signals in the environment. Her ability set, agility, and varied assortment of assault rifles make her a capable operator well-suited towards both Disarm Bomb and Terrorist Hunt Classic modes.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Fuze</h2><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2940684-classmenus.00_00_55_03.still005.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team: &lt;/strong&gt;Attackers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affiliation: &lt;/strong&gt;Spetznaz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description: &lt;/strong&gt;Fuze is an operator best used during breaching scenarios. His special item is a concussion launcher, a device that pokes a small hole into the wall and shoots concussion grenades onto the other side. If used in conjunction with a breaching charge, you can create a devastating one-two punch combo that can completely stun and ambush opponents who foolishly decide to hole up in a single room. Just make sure to throw a drone in the room to check things out so you don&#039;t waste it. &lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Doc</h2><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2940683-classmenus.00_01_17_11.still006.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team: &lt;/strong&gt;Defenders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affiliation: &lt;/strong&gt;GIGN (National Gendarmerie Intervention Group)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description: &lt;/strong&gt;Doc is the designated healing operator. Using a special pistol that fires hypodermic shots, he can revive himself and even downed teammates from a distance. Due to this ability, Doc is a highly useful operator, especially in any Team Deathmatch mode. However, if you&#039;re ever facing up against him, it&#039;s important to make sure you&#039;ve actually killed him since his presence can be a serious game changer against your team. &lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Bandit</h2><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2940682-classmenus.00_00_41_03.still004.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team: &lt;/strong&gt;Defenders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affiliation: &lt;/strong&gt;GSG 9 (Border Protection Group 9 of the Federal Police)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description: &lt;/strong&gt;Bandit is a resourceful and flexible operator who can use an item called the Shock Wire, a device that be hooked onto metallic objects to imbue them with an electrical charge. Compatible objects include barricades, barbed wire, and even riot shields.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Jäger</h2><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2940681-classmenus.00_00_29_18.still003.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team: &lt;/strong&gt;Defenders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affiliation: &lt;/strong&gt;GSG 9 (Border Protection Group 9 of the Federal Police)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description: &lt;/strong&gt;As a technician well-versed in complex gadgets, Jäger is an operator armed with an Active Defense system that can zap incoming frag or stun grenades out of the air. While a useful tool to have in any PvE mode to deflect the countless grenades thrown at you by AI, it can serve as a detriment in Team Deathmatch - Hostage mode where getting an enemy team to frag the hostage becomes an instant winning strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/> ",

Fatman was an eclectic bad guy who scooted around on rollerblades hiding C4 bombs throughout the Big Shell. Having to disarm the bombs and defeat Fatman made it a memorable exchange.

Players had to watch out for the rejuvenation pool in the center of the action; falling it was lethal.

This showdown was years in the making, and it did not disappoint. After attacking Vamp, players were dismayed to learn that his health quickly regenerated. The trick: Injecting Vamp with a syringe when his health was low.

It was also fitting that what might be Hideo Kojima’s last &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear&lt;/em&gt; wrapped up with man versus machine.

There are cold, hard numbers to consider, such as Metacritic scores. But there&#039;s also the intangible feeling that a movie gives an audience–the surprise and delight of seeing an old genre in a new way. For our ranking, we took critical reception into account, but we also went with our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;At No. 1: Donnie Darko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;The original release of this smartly crafted, moving portrait of a gifted but disturbed kid (Jake Gyllenhaal) became a cult favorite. And the director&#039;s cut adds extra depth to the subversive teen&#039;s time travels through alternative universes, as he manipulates his fate in this surreal, mind-bending cult film. See it again for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/donnie-darko-the-directors-cut&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Metacritic score: 88&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Photo by: Newmarket Films&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>2.

This twisted romance is charmingly sincere in its comedic and dramatic vision of love and loss, combined with a mind-bending take on how to move forward and start anew. Eccentric but accessible, it&#039;s a &lt;i&gt;memorable&lt;/i&gt; masterwork of the fantasy genre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; data-mce-href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind&quot;&gt;Metacritic score: 89&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Photo by: Focus Features&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>3.

Our eco-warrior hero basks in the loneliness of his toil, but the story morphs into a refreshingly comic romance that effortlessly delves into what it means to be truly human&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/wall-e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Metacritic score: 94&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(Photo by: Pixar)&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>4.

But it&#039;s everything else – the production design, the romance, the intrigue, the choreography, the supremely confident acting – that makes it a must-see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; data-mce-href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon&quot;&gt;Metacritic score: 93&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(Photo by: Sony Pictures Classics)&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>5.

The picture fleshes out Tolkien&#039;s often two-dimensional world of heroes and villains, adding gritty footage of refugees and other elements that elevate this story beyond mere fantasy. The Two Towers also happens to be a darned capable war picture; the Battle of Helm&#039;s Deep (or the Hornburg, if you prefer) gets better with each viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; data-mce-href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers&quot;&gt;Metacritic score: 88&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(Photo by: New Line Cinema)&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>7.

But this film, with its unique cast of bad-news spirits taking their ease at a supernatural spa, has a heft and a creative confidence that goes beyond most animated movies of any century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/spirited-away&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; data-mce-href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/spirited-away&quot;&gt;Metacritic score: 94&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(Photo by: Toho/Studio Ghibli)&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>8.

Top critics call this Swedish flick one of the greatest supernatural films of the new millennium, and they&#039;re right. We won&#039;t give anything away, except to say this: If it&#039;s at all possible to feel sorry for a bully, this film will bring out that sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/let-the-right-one-in&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Metacritic score: 82&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(Photo by: Magnolia Pictures)&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>9.

The tension is sky high, the visual effects are amazing and the acting is superb from Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in this state-of-the-art sci-fi tale from Alfonso Cuarón.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/gravity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Metacritic score: 96&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(Photo by: Warner Bros.)&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>10.

Doug Jones, who plays the faun, rivals Andy Serkis as one of the greatest creature actors of his time, and his work here is superb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pans-labyrinth&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; data-mce-href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pans-labyrinth&quot;&gt;Metacritic score: 98&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(Photo by: Picturehouse)&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>11.

Clive Owen stars as the world-weary man smuggling an expectant mother to a safe zone. Though there&#039;s plenty of action and intrigue, the most dramatic moments come from the simple primal moments we take for granted, like a mother giving birth, or the cry of a newborn baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/children-of-men&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; data-mce-href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/children-of-men&quot;&gt;Metacritic score: 84&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(Photo by: Universal Pictures)&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>12.

Man&#039;s inhumanity to, well, inhumanity, gets even weirder when a human becomes an accidental hybrid with the ability to control alien weapons. Quirky-cool and creative, District 9 is a space film that&#039;s a chase film and a whole lotta thoughtful fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/district-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Metacritic score: 81&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(Photo by: TriStar Pictures)&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>18.

Depp&#039;s genius interpretation of Jack Sparrow, a mix between Blackbeard and Keith Richards, is a heady mug o&#039; grog. The movie is worth seeing for his performance alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Metacritic score: 63&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;(Photo by: Buena Vista Pictures)&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/> ",

But throughout his extensive career, he has also made appearances in other games too, some of them you might have never expected to see him in. So to celebrate this lovable Italian plumber&#039;s 30th anniversary, here are some of his most unexpected cameo appearances that you might&#039;ve missed.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Pinball</h2><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2935844-wiiu_vc_nes_pinball_screens_01.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mario made a cameo appearance in a bonus stage in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/pinball/&quot;&gt;Pinball&lt;/a&gt; for the NES. Bearing similarities to &lt;a href=&quot;/breakout/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;5000-2426&quot;&gt;Breakout&lt;/a&gt;, the goal of the bonus stage was for Mario to use a platform to bounce a pinball into rows of objects to save the distressed Pauline above. &lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Tennis</h2><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2936409-screen+shot+2015-09-11+at+2.10.49+pm.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;While gamers predominantly know Mario for being a plumber, he also worked a job as a tennis umpire. As you can see from his cameo appearance in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/tennis/&quot;&gt;Tennis&lt;/a&gt; for the NES, he was quite skilled at making fair judgments.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Punch-Out!!</h2><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2935847-screen+shot+2015-09-10+at+2.04.35+pm+%282%29.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;On top of being a plumber and tennis umpire, Mario also famously appeared as a boxing referee in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/punch-out/&quot;&gt;Punch-Out!!&lt;/a&gt; Despite being an advocate for a fair fight, he counted way too slow during the game&#039;s final bout.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Tetris</h2><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2935846-screen+shot+2015-09-10+at+11.53.41+am.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you beat the NES version of &lt;a href=&quot;/tetris/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;5000-5520&quot;&gt;Tetris&lt;/a&gt; in B-mode on the highest difficulty, Mario can be found angrily dancing alongside Luigi above the Kremlin in the credits screen. Also appearing with them are other classic Nintendo characters, like Princess Peach, Donkey Kong, Kid Icarus, Samus Aran, and Link.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>SimCity</h2><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2935848-screen+shot+2015-09-10+at+2.00.43+pm.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the SNES version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/simcity-1991/&quot;&gt;SimCity&lt;/a&gt;, Mario appears as an unlockable statue that you can put up once your city&#039;s population reaches 500,000 residents. Who needs the Statue of Liberty anyway when you can have a giant statue of Mario instead?&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Kirby Super Star</h2><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2935849-screen+shot+2015-09-10+at+1.34.32+pm.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mario and several other characters from the Mushroom Kingdom can be seen in the audience during the Megaton Punch Championship in &lt;a href=&quot;/kirby-super-star/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;5000-17528&quot;&gt;Kirby Super Star&lt;/a&gt;. Surprisingly, their identical twins also decided to come out to watch the competition.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes</h2><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2935850-metal-gear-solid-twin-snakes-mario-e-yoshi.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/metal-gear-solid-the-twin-snakes/&quot;&gt;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&lt;/a&gt;, Mario and Yoshi figurines could be spotted in Otacon&#039;s lab on the second floor basement of the nuclear storage building. If you fire a weapon at Mario, he&#039;ll make a 1-Up noise that&#039;ll restore some of your life bar, while firing at Yoshi will result in him saying his name.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>NBA Street v3</h2><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2935865-screen+shot+2015-09-10+at+2.23.32+pm.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a part of a three game deal between Nintendo and EA to have Nintendo characters appear in EA franchises, Mario was included as a playable character in the Gamecube version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/nba-street-v3/&quot;&gt;NBA Street V3&lt;/a&gt;. And as you can see above, the result was by far one of the strangest cameos he ever made.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>SSX On Tour</h2><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2935864-screen+shot+2015-09-10+at+2.19.53+pm.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;As the second game in the deal between Nintendo and EA, Mario took to the slopes alongside Luigi and Princess Peach in &lt;a href=&quot;/ssx-on-tour/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;5000-24060&quot;&gt;SSX On Tour&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully, the appearance was a better fit than the stark contrast in style seen in NBA Street V3.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Pilotwings 64</h2><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2935866-screen+shot+2015-09-10+at+2.24.04+pm.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the Mount Rushmore section of the Little States level in&lt;a href=&quot;/pilotwings-64/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;5000-1615&quot;&gt; Pilotwings 64&lt;/a&gt;, you can find Mario&#039;s face in place of where George Washington&#039;s should be. Though, if you shoot his face, it&#039;ll fall apart and reveal Wario&#039;s face instead.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</h2><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2936470-oot_bowserportrait.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;While Mario has made numerous cameo appearances in The Legend of Zelda series, a notable one that&#039;s slightly difficult to spot is his appearance in &lt;a href=&quot;/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;5000-1272&quot;&gt;Ocarina of Time&lt;/a&gt;. If you look closely in the area where Princess Zelda usually stands in Hyrule Castle, there are actually paintings of Mario and others hung up on the walls.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Just Dance 3</h2><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2935855-mario-dance.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mario made a cameo appearance in a song for &lt;a href=&quot;/just-dance-3/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;5000-107446&quot;&gt;Just Dance 3&lt;/a&gt; called &quot;Just Mario.&quot; In it, the plump Italian plumber can be seen doing all kinds of sweet dance moves to classic tunes from the Mario series.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Taiko no Tatsujin</h2><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2935856-22toj.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/taiko-no-tatsujin-wii/&quot;&gt;Taiko no Tatsujin&lt;/a&gt;, or Taiko Drum Master as its known in North America, features a Mario-themed medley track where Mario, Luigi, Blue Toad, and Yellow Toad appear in the background and run through a level as the song is being played.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Scribblenauts Unlimited</h2><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2935843-scribblenautsu_mario_03.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mario appears in the Wii U and 3DS versions of &lt;a href=&quot;/scribblenauts-unlimited/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;5000-143724&quot;&gt;Scribblenauts Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; as a guest object you can spawn into a level. Initially a peaceful object you can co-exist with in-game, he will become hostile if put in the presence of Bowser, Koopa Troopa, and Goomba objects.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Pac-Man Vs.</h2><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2936486-screen+shot+2015-09-11+at+4.28.25+pm+%282%29.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Unlike other games in this list, Mario&#039;s cameo in Pac-Man Vs. for the Gamecube is much more subtle. As opposed to being a straight-up appearance, the red-hatted plumber shows up in this multiplayer Pac-Man game as its announcer, spouting off phrases like &quot;Go go go!&quot; and &quot;You can do it!&quot; While Mario&#039;s voice is a weird touch in a non-Nintendo game devoid of his presence, it&#039;s worth noting that Shigeru Miyamoto himself designed the game.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/> ",

But because of how detailed it is, there&#039;s a lot of content in the game that you might not know to try. Whether it be calling in a supply drop on an enemy or recruiting Hideo Kojima to Mother Base, here&#039;s a gallery of the most entertaining things you might have missed!&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Happy Birthday to You!</h2><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2933258-screen+shot+2015-09-04+at+4.48.21+pm+%282%29.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;During the opening moments of MGS V, you&#039;re asked to enter your name and birth date. While this doesn’t serve any purpose to gameplay, it does trigger a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/videos/metal-gear-solid-5-birthday-easter-egg/2300-6426877/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;2300-6426877&quot;&gt;hilarious cut scene&lt;/a&gt; upon returning to Mother Base on the selected birth date where your staff welcomes you with a surprise Birthday greeting.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>A Supply Drop to the Face</h2><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2933264-screen+shot+2015-09-04+at+4.59.17+pm+%282%29.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Calling for helicopter supply drops in MGS V is an easy way to replenish your ammo and item reserves in the field, but it&#039;s also a creative means to take out stationary enemies. Just pick supply drop from the Missions tab, choose an enemy&#039;s location as a drop point, and wait as the incoming package plops right on their head, rendering them unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Cardboard Box Sledding</h2><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2933259-maxresdefault.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;The classic cardboard box is back, and it&#039;s got a hidden feature: it doubles as a sled! Run down a hill with the box equipped and use the dive command to sled down hills and mountains. You pick up speed pretty quickly, and have surprisingly good steering, too. Box sledding is a great way to take out unexpected enemies, and it&#039;s just plain fun!&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Box Posters</h2><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2933261-screen+shot+2015-09-04+at+4.56.30+pm+%282%29.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;The cardboard box also comes with the ability to customize it with posters you can find and collect in the game. Depending on the poster you pick, it’ll have different humorous effects on your enemies. If you attach a Soviet Guard poster, enemy guards in Afghanistan can be fooled from a distance into thinking you’re a comrade, and if you attach a pin-up girl poster, you can attract the attention of enemy guards over to your position.

Luckily for you, the details you need to know before playing the newest game aren’t as hefty as you might think. So join us, as we run you down on the most important tidbits needed to understand the story of the Metal Gear Solid universe.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Vital Fact: Metal Gear Solid V Is a Part of a Prequel Saga</h2><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2932254-mgs3-naked-snake-virtuous-mission.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;An essential fact to know about MGS V is that its overarching story splits into two major arcs. The first centres on Big Boss, who stars in the first half of the series timeline, which in chronological order is: MGS 3, Peace Walker, Ground Zeroes, and MGS V: The Phantom Pain. The second half centres on Solid Snake, who stars in Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2, MGS, MGS 2, and finally MGS 4. Both characters come face-to-face in several of these games.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Question: So who is…Big Boss or Whatever?</h2><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2932253-2829367-big%2Bboss%27s%2Bscars.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Big Boss is a legendary war hero and the genetic father of Solid Snake (more on that later). He becomes a major antagonist later in the series&#039; chronology who wanted to become a global military power with the use of Metal Gears, which are nuclear equipped bipedal tanks. In his early years, he was a patriotic U.S. soldier who constantly saved the world from the threat of Metal Gear-like weapons. However, it was his first big mission that led him down a path towards disillusionment.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Game Summary: Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</h2><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2932257-maxresdefault+%281%29.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;In 1964, Big Boss--known then under the codename of Naked Snake--was sent on a mission in the Soviet Jungle as an operative of FOX, a U.S. Special Forces group. He was to rescue a soviet rocket scientist, but failed when his former mentor, known as The Boss, appeared and wounded him as an act of betrayal. Once recovered from his injuries, Big Boss was sent on a new mission called Operation: Snake Eater. His objective was to kill The Boss as well as disable the Shagohod; an experimental prototype tank capable of launching a nuke. Despite losing an eye, Big Boss was successful, but he discovered that the mission was a ruse. What the U.S. was really seeking was something called the Philosophers&#039; Legacy; a $100 billion cash reserve that had been amassed by a secret group of world leaders called the Philosophers. Big Boss, having killed his mentor against his wishes, for a mission that turned out to be bogus, was left disenfranchised with his country.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Key Character: The Boss</h2><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2932234-screen+shot+2015-09-02+at+4.20.44+pm.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>The Boss was a decorated American soldier and former mentor of Big Boss. The two shared a strong spiritual bond and developed the art of CQC (Close Quarters Combat) together. During the events of MGS 3, the U.S. sent her on a mission to pretend to defect to the Soviet Union and recover the Philosophers’ Legacy, which was suspected to be in possession of a rogue soviet colonel named Borisovitch Volgin. But when he fired a handheld nuclear missile at his own country, the U.S. was accused by the Soviet Union of provoking a nuclear war. As a result, the U.S. ordered The Boss to pretend to have acted alone, thus absolving the U.S. from any guilt. The Boss sacrificed her honor, continued to pretend to have been a national traitor, and died at the hands of her apprentice.</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Important Motivation: The Boss’ Will</h2><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2932259-screen+shot+2015-09-02+at+5.36.26+pm+%282%29.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>Prior to the events of MGS 3, The Boss unofficially became the first American sent into space. During her time up in Earth’s atmosphere, seeing the planet from up above inspired a dream to unite the world as one, outside of political allegiances and petty competition. This dream became known to characters in the Metal Gear Solid universe as The Boss’ will.</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>The Philosophers</h2><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2932263-screen+shot+2015-09-02+at+5.44.28+pm.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Composed of the highest powers from different branches of the U.S., Soviet Union, and China, the Philosophers were a secret group formed after World War I to steer history away from needless warfare. But following the death of its last remaining original member by 1930, the group spiraled into corruption. During the Second World War, the group amassed the Philosophers&#039; Legacy as a means of ensuring victory against the Axis powers via advanced weapons development. Once the conflict was over, it was intended for the funds to be split evenly among the nations. However, the money was secretly stolen by Volgin&#039;s father and distributed into several bank accounts. The records of these transactions were then stored on a microfilm and passed on to Volgin after his father&#039;s death. The scramble to find the microfilm caused tension between each nation&#039;s branch of Philosophers as their hunger for power led to a struggle to secure all the money for themselves. The competition for the Philosopher&#039;s Legacy is what sparked the events in Snake Eater, and ultimately, Big Boss&#039; detachment from his former alliances.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Key Character: Zero</h2><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2932233-03.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>Zero was Big Boss’ commanding officer during Operation: Snake Eater. In the aftermath of the mission&#039;s completion, he grew tired of the Philosophers, whose bickering nature he felt degenerated the organization into squabbling factions. With the help of a U.S. spy codenamed Ocelot, he acquired the Philosopher’s Legacy and a full list of its members. He then eliminated the Philosophers and started his own secret organization called The Patriots.</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Key Character: Ocelot</h2><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2932232-maxresdefault.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ocelot first appeared during the events of MGS 3 as a member of an elite soviet unit known as the GRU, and on various occasions, he would get in the way of Big Boss. While an enemy at first, it turned out that Ocelot was actually an American spy who acquired half of the Philosopher’s Legacy for the CIA portion of the American Philosophers. Growing disenfranchised with the Philosophers as a whole, Ocelot eventually stole back the Legacy from the CIA, acquired the whereabouts of the other half, and aligned himself with Zero to assist in the formation of the Patriots.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>The Patriots</h2><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2932230-screen+shot+2015-09-02+at+4.13.30+pm.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>With the end of the Philosophers, Zero began his own secret organization known as The Patriots (codenamed Cipher). Alongside him were Big Boss, Ocelot, former members of FOX, and an ex-spy from China named EVA. Together they worked to fulfill The Boss’ will of uniting the world as one.</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>A Difference in Interpretation</h2><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2932231-screen+shot+2015-09-02+at+4.15.57+pm.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>As the Patriots worked together, it became increasingly clear that Big Boss and Zero disagreed in their interpretations of The Boss’ will. Zero was convinced that in order to fulfill it, he needed to turn Big Boss into a messiah-like icon and unify the world as one by controlling information. However, Big Boss strongly resented this, resulting in a falling-out in his relationship to Zero.</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Les Enfants Terribles</h2><img src=\"http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2932227-screen+shot+2015-09-02+at+4.08.55+pm.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>Fearing the loss of Big Boss as an icon, Zero tasked scientists with creating clones of him. The project--referred to as Les Enfants Terribles--initially gave birth to octuplets, but six of the embryos in the egg were aborted to secure Big Boss&#039; dominant and recessive genes. What resulted were twin clone sons: Liquid Snake and Solid Snake. When Big Boss caught wind of this, he decided to leave the Patriots to secretly form his own private mercenary army in opposition to Zero. Meanwhile, the twin sons remained alive and healthy. Those who have played earlier games in the series will know that these twins would later become major characters in the future of the Metal Gear Solid chronology.</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Game Summary: Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</h2><img src=\"http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2932210-mgs_peacewalker_psp_edit053.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;In 1974, Big Boss--still calling himself Snake--built up a private mercenary group called MSF (Militaires sans Frontieres). His group was hired by University professor Ramon Galvez and his student Paz Ortega to get rid of an unknown armed force in Costa Rica. Upon investigating, Big Boss discovered a giant bipedal tank controlled by an AI called Peace Walker, which was built by a rogue CIA unit to ensure nuclear deterrence. Big Boss succeeded in destroying it, and decided to finally take on the codename of Big Boss. However, he was soon double-crossed by Paz, who revealed herself as an agent of The Patriots under Zero’s orders to force him to rejoin the group. To ensure this, Paz hijacked Metal Gear ZEKE, a nuclear-equipped bipedal tank built by MSF, but Big Boss stopped her. He then assured his army that he’ll build a mercenary haven free of politics and nation: Outer Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Key Character: Kazuhira Miller</h2><img src=\"http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2932209-screen+shot+2015-09-02+at+4.04.39+pm+%282%29.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>Kazuhira Miller is the second-in-command of MSF and a comrade of Big Boss. Looking to expand MSF and the construction of its Mother Base, Miller conducted dealings with The Patriots, due to his belief in the mercenary business as a potential new driving force for the economy. As a result, Miller&#039;s actions helped instigate the events of MGS: Peace Walker as he had been in on Paz’s schemes the entire time, and was the one who orchestrated her meeting with Big Boss. Despite this clear betrayal, Big Boss still forgave Miller for his misdeeds since the progress they made in establishing MSF as a powerful trendsetter for military operations was undeniable.</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Game Summary: Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes</h2><img src=\"http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/536/5360430/2405339-mgsvgz_ss_game_003.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;In 1975, Big Boss and Miller prepared MSF for an upcoming UN inspection amid suspicions that they possessed a nuclear weapon. Meanwhile, a report surfaced that Paz was still alive and was being held in a Cuban prison camp. The situation was further complicated when Chico, a child soldier from Mother Base, was caught at the prison camp searching for Paz. While Miller and MSF scientist Huey Emmerich handled the inspection, Big Boss infiltrated the camp, rescued Paz and Chico, and escaped via helicopter. On the way back, Chico discovered that a bomb was surgically implanted in Paz, which an MSF medic then removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;When the group returned to Mother Base, they discovered it being attacked by a mysterious unit known as XOF. Caught in a desperate firefight, Big Boss quickly retrieved Miller, but as they fled, Mother Base was completely wiped out. Paz then woke up and warned the group that there was another bomb inside her. Anticipating inevitable death, Paz jumped out before it could explode. The resulting explosive force caused the group&#039;s helicopter to spiral out of control and into a pursuing XOF aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;</h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>V Has Come To.</h2><img src=\"http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_large/1552/15524586/2932316-large.jpg\" /><br/><em></em><br /><h3>From what we know of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&#039;s premise, Big Boss entered into a coma after the events of Ground Zeroes.
